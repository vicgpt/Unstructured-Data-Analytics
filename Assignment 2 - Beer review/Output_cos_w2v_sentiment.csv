793,Morning Wood,pours a pitch black coloration with a large creamy head smell is quite sweet and dominated by maple syrup with hints of lightly roasted caramel malt and chocolate coffee and bourbon notes taste follows the nose being quite sweet and absolutely dominated by maple syrup and caramel lightly roasted malt with lighter notes of coffee chocolateand lovely vanilla bourbon notes as well as a certain earthy woody oak presence finishes bittersweet with a light bitterness and an almost cloying maple sweetness lingering in the aftertaste thick mouthfeel with a mediumrich body and medium carbonation  while this is a really nice stout its still highly overrated in my personal opinion due to a poor balance that heavily favors an intense maple sweetness that almost drowns out most of the other flavors while there really isnt that much coffee to it either its one saving grace are some lovely bourbon and oak notes that both complement the flavor profile while at the same time adding some much needed depth im certainly not getting any salty bacon from this either certainly enjoyable but far from worldclass in my personal opinion although this may also be due to the bottle being already 18 months old when i had it i could imagine the coffee being more intense and creating a better balance against the maple when this is fresh,0.6208202501497737,0.979

911,Westly,pours a clouded amberorange color with a froth stable head  smells of yogurt orange sorbet and fresh cut apricots got a unique funk profile to it which leads to a apricot stone pit quality among wet earth and moldy wood while this is pretty fruit centered it leaves enough space on the palate for the funk to play an important role on the aromas as it sets the state of the fruits somewhere between wet and juicy  has a soft lighter mouthfeel with a well nuanced sparkly effervescence during the beers finish  tastes of an initial bread dough softness which turns more mineralic once the carbonation becomes recognizable which also brings the fruits to the palate turns quite acidic then making the beer utmost sour with an almost calming presence of unripe apricots the apricots take a sweet turn then developing a sudden utmost pleasant ripeness which blends perfectly into cream cheese and leather develops a late yogurt funk note with a sparkly rock licking impression turning the fruits a little younger again with a late funky sourness  this is solid with a slightly more pronounced fruity and sourness lacks depth apart from that while its sourness is too pronounced,0.620660320237567,0.9742

1025,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,2018 vintage  750ml bottle  poured into a balloon stem at 50f huge thanks to donniet79 for this longtime want  pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour  absorbing every photon of light with the single darkest head on a beer that ive ever seen forming  like a grade school volcano it foams up  fine and sudsy with the colour of light coffee beans and then receding to a huge persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever 475  nose incredibly rich almost like a concentrate deep bold roasted malts with a particularly russianstyle accord lend bitter bakers chocolate cacao peruvian coffee black treacle toffee caramel marzipan and vanilla a slight dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny px sherry note with a hint of fig blueberry and dried cherry im failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon but there is a unique warm spice element lending a hint of earthiness not very mexican but it smells delicious 425  palate the legendary hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialedin balance between malt sweetness and roast immediately it lets you know that it is not trying to be a mexican wedding cake  this is a russian imperial stout with a bold heavy roast deep dark bitter complexion and leaning drier on the sweetness scale roasty is the main theme here bitter cocoa charred malts burned sugar and burned vanilla lead the way with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness the pepper is there if you really squint but rather than lending a chili heat its more of an earthy dry spice spice as in spices not heat im not picking up on cinnamon perhaps due to its age but theres definitely some type of spice character thats lending an earthy aromatic quality it grows drier nudging out any sweetness and the charred malt takes hold upping the dry bitter factor the faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges and the stout concludes with deep bitter roast cacao and an almost tannic bite to it which lingers resurfacing with an espresso like aftertaste 40  mouthfeelbody despite its foreboding motor oil appearance hunahpu is quite drinkable a bold rich heavy brew but hes quite fluid with a mediumfull body and very minimal viscosity theres some fine subtle fizzy effervescence but its relegated to the background and only just contributes enough the chilies warm only the gums and it concludes with a drying tannic roasty squeeze 425  overall this is a tricky one for me i know this is revered as a legend and was once highly soughtafter and perhaps the age didnt treat this one the best but i have a hard time falling in love with it its a bit roasty and bitter for my taste and feel it trends more in the classic russian style than anything else its a great ris especially if you like them bitter and roasty and the hint of pepper is a nice twist but i keepwishing that it were just a touch sweeter less roasty with more carameltoffeevanillamalt and less cacaocharblackened bite i can certainly see how the right person would adore this though i just find the roast a bit overbearing  375,0.6199772114794702,0.9973

3565,No Rules,2017 bottle poured into a goblet glass an opaque dark brown color with a modest tan head aroma had sweet coconut chocolate caramel and subtle bourbon the taste followed really bright coconut flavor up front the barrel was more prominent and really balanced sweet coconut and chocolate all the way through totally stood up to the hype,0.6128408388907733,0.9014
571,Abner,drinking this in a dark bar so hard to get a good read on the appearance faint very faint notes of grassearth and citrus rind on the nose would expect more aromas from a hf ipa  taste is somewhat muted a little grapefruit bitterness a little pine and not much else not as juicy or expressive as society and solitude offerings  feel is effervescent and light good carb doesnt coat the mouth despite its abv  overall good  and glad i tried this but prefer other hf hoppy offerings,0.6127652106096362,0.5727
6156,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,2019 vintage pours deep brown with a small mocha head that fades fast no lacing  smells of chocolate bourbon coconut and faint maple  taste follows the nose i appreciate that the sweetness doesnt overpower  on the thin side with low carbonation drinks nicely for such a big beer a bit more mouthfeel would make this one upper tier  really nice beer but not on the level of some others and the price point sucks,0.6127557745949203,0.1397
3492,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,this beer pours blacker than the midnight sky with a one finger super fizzy chocolate milkshake colored head retention is low and there are sparse chunks of sticky lacing left on the glass  smell is very strong bourbon and sweet milk chocolate along with some caramel vanilla and oak  taste is the same starts off with a huge helping of sweet chocolate cake that transitions to the caramel and vanilla mid sip with a bourbon and oak finish the bourbon flavor is huge but somehow this beer is in no way boozy  feel is full side of medium slick oily and really coats the whole palate carbonation is right on the money  overall this beer is excellent the body could be a little more thick but the booze is so well hidden the bourbon and chocolate also go together wonderfully the bourbon adds complexity and cuts through the sweetness of the base beer fantastic,0.6127429161508974,0.983

3863,Montmorency Vs Balaton,unbelievably huge thanks to anthony for this massive want of mine very excited  500ml bottle  b6 feb 19 poured into a fancy tulip at 48f  pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red  im talking the sorcerers stone red highly polished highly reflective mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red  clear but not crystal a finger of quick loose justslightlypink head builds up and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar some slow effervescence can be seen  nose there are average cherry wild ales and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma this is in the latter category the amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated while being entirely organic in nature not only is this a cherry bomb aroma but what is really impressive is how both the montmorency and the balaton cherries seem to translate there is some intensely sweet ripe juicy balaton character lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note bursting with big deep dark cherry juice while the montmorency cherries lend that floral fresh tangy cherry note with a touch of stem pit and even cherry blossom there is also a healthy amount of oak and along with the cherries seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note with just a whisper of oaky vanillins there is a suggestion of acidity but it doesnt singe the nose when inhaling and theres very little earthy or barnyard funk just some wet oak leather old parchment dusty attic and a hint of brett the cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath theres a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything which is the icing on the cake  palate first thing from the very first sip it isnt bracing sourness that hits it isnt tannic oak it isnt malt its sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh the deep bold balaton sweetness greets the palate giving up its sweet juicy goodness while never coming across as artificial cough syrupy sticky or overly sweet this sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the montmorency character beneath the montmorency is not quite as deep bold and saturated with juicy sweetness but it provides a slightly less ripe slightly fruitier character that brings japanese cherry blossom a bit of plum a hint of cherry potpourri cinnamonamburana wood spice and a bright natural almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table in addition to this subtle fruity tartness the acidity lends a nearperfect degree of sour it really isnt bracing puckering or blinding in any way make no mistake this is a sour ale no question about it but it isnt midwest sour there is some lemony lacto pucker a bit less of some acetic pedio bite and a bit more of some tart funky mineralic brett lending not quite salinity and definitely not sweat but that classic restrained brett tang along with some musty wet wood a little hint of bandaid and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note the high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a kriek vibe the tartness has a quick downward curve allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish paired with a hint of vanilla a hint of baking spice a hint of caramel and a hint of brown sugar the sourness takes a far back seat revealing some more dusty brett and then finally the eversoslightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley cereal grains essence of cherry and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish  mouthfeelbody mvb is light crisp and snappy by nature though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to mediumbodied territory effervescence is surprisingly low it isnt flat but rather lazy and slow one might expect this to be a super fizzy champagnelike experience but that is not the case which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel soft round and even quite juicy upfront the ale is not scrubbing and even feels somewhat smooth the oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades but the ale itself isnt tannic or ultradry  overall this is a really remarkable cherry wild ale and an absolute triumph from jester king the perceivable differences between the montmorency and balaton cherries is a work of art and the structure balance and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive the acidity is forward but kept in check the sweetness makes a statement up front and then takes a supporting role the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced and the subtle malty grainy base beneath it all is something that i always look for but rarely get in highly acidic ales this is just absolutely world class,0.6126614743105198,0.9988

457,Julius,im not sure if ive ever rated a beer this high before the color was an opaque orange juice nose was slight bitter hop with many tropical fruits and citrus taking center stage taste follows suit but bitter hop is almost not there rather a slight dank taste is present on the back end but the front is all fruit and citrus puree mouthfeel is so pillowy and soft its reminiscent of a stout or thick porter this beer was excellent and i will seek out more,0.6106785667546686,0.2882

3288,Bomb!,poured into a teku glass from a 12oz bottle  the look of this beer was a very dark brown reminiscent of cold brew coffee this honestly didnt really have a head to it so i cant really comment on the head but there was a very thin dark drown lacing around my glass  the aroma was heavy on the ancho chilies which was super pungent upfront it wasnt a onenote smell though the ancho chillies served as a backbone for an overall savory slightly sweet and unique aroma supported by bitter coffee notes and a slight caramel sweetness from the roasted malts the aroma almost reminded me a little of korean red pepper paste but i can also see people thinking this also smells a bit like soy sauce  the taste more or less followed the aroma the taste of the ancho chillies with a mellow coffee backbone permeated throughout the entire stout from start to finish although this beer primarily tasted of ancho chilies i was also really able to taste most of the different flavorings added to this beer upfront you get the taste of ancho chilies with a mellow coffee herbalnessbitterness that was complimented with a caramel sweetness the sweet taste of the caramel seemingly disappeared towards the middle and end which left me with the roasty taste of coffee that was also paired with notes of bitter dark chocolate and of course ancho chillies i couldnt necessarily taste the vanilla beans which was added to this but i felt like it served to mellow and round out the other bolder ingredients which were added  the feel on this was medium to full bodied had little to no noticeable carbonation and had a moderate lingering bitterness all which contributed in making a silky smooth drinking experience for the abv this was stupid drinkable and i felt like i had to keep reminding myself to slow it down and sip that being said i couldnt really taste the alcohol in this and there werent any burning sensations  overall i have to say that this was definitely one of the more unique beers that ive ever had the addition of ancho chillies worked pretty well when combined with coffee cacao nibs and vanilla beans which i felt made this beer a satisfying explosion no pun intended of savoriness sweetness and roasty bitterness definitely good and definitely worth the price tag,0.6083456451331919,0.9926

2056,Black Note Stout,2017 vintage bottled on 100517 purchased at loosa brews tuscaloosa al  dark murky pour without too much viscosity but a greatlooking stout poured from the bottle a decent amount of beige head rises and settles in a good sized ring around the inside of the glass  tons of dark chocolate and dried fruit on the nose that swirl around a backbone of oaky booze and roasty malt really a little bit of everything you could ask for of the style in the aromas with the essence only intensifying as it warms  distinctly different from the nose a good compliment roasty espresso caramel and bitter bakers chocolate flavors with a potent booziness that laces its way through the palate and lingers along with a predominant malt in the finish i would have hoped only for a touch more sweetness to cut through that potent booze and bitterness but its not at all intended to take away from the overall pleasant experience  the body is fairly thin retaining a good amount of carbonation that i feel like could even have been a little softer sticky with a good residual mouthcoating and warm boozy finish,0.5981822200393205,0.9863

2462,Black Gold,pouring a slick stark black ribbon and filling to matte black black gold has a thin but dense and uniform mochagold blanket that settles only to a thin ring around the rim  i could smell this all day black gold has a very mapleforward character thats slightly smoky sticky and sweet and very rich nutty and surprisingly peppery oak follows with notes of chocolate wafer and a dollop of vanilla whip cream a faint sting of bourbon complexity comes out at the end of an inhale bringing with it a hint of caramel and candy corn  it immediately strikes me how very dry and very woody yet somehow not hot this is at first taste which is a telling mark of excellent blending taste verges away from the maple in the aroma and instead goes in the direction of toasted coconut and smooth vanilla with an unbelievably delectable char that rises after the swallow its kind of like salted caramel and brownie crust but quite notably mature particularly as it warms when mocha liqueur and tobacco develop  the medium body is supported by a mildly firm and satisfying fizz before a semidry slightly sticky finish a building warmth comes up quite a while after the swallow but theres amazingly little heat on the front or middle,0.5978193603682685,0.9921

4738,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,a huge thanks to nick for this one you are far too generous  355ml bottle  no date 18 or 19 im sure  poured into a balloon stem at 48f  pours a thin mahogany brown with amber highlights sitting basically black in the glass when held to the light the beer appears clear deep garnet red with micro suspended particulate a finger of very light foamy tan head forms and recedes fairly quickly leaving a nice collar  nose compared to so many maple beers out there two things stand out here one the maple is strong  balanced not overpowering but very forward two the maple is very organic  like a pot with dark maple syrup reducing notes of maple fudge chocolate chip pancakes fresh light roast coffee and a very subtle smokiness underneath it all that i would attribute to smoked malt no bacon but i could definitely see maple sausage it really does smell like a chocolate chip pancake breakfast with coffee  palate the beer greets the palate porterfirst it isnt pastry and constantly remains real beer a very nice porter base too  roasty but lightly so with very little malt sweetness and no char to speak of a touch nutty with a bit of cocoa and toffee the maple is everconstant lending a faint background sweetness while the coffee stays restrained tasting not like grounds but a smooth lightly sweetened cup of light roast the coffee note opens up towards the finish as the maple slowly subsides letting a bit of meaty emptiness come through it isnt quite bacon but its a nice touch and i can pretend the finish is light coffee subtle cocoa a trailing hint of maple and a kiss of smoke  mouthfeelbody its a 64 abv porter theres no reason to assume this will be thick or chewy and it isnt its mediumbodied fluid up front but with some of that porter heft to it it isnt thin nor thick its right where it should be drinkable not watery effervescence is medium  gentle with fine soft bubbles semisweet with a moderately dry finish with lingering maltiness an iota of stickiness  overall this takes everything that the breakfast stout has made famous and delivers it in a smaller porter format the maple is beautifully integrated the coffee is top notch albeit a bit restrained and theres a nice subtle smoky element threading through the porter itself is fantastic with the perfect malt bill and great attenuation its bold balanced and deviates from the norm all of the breakfast stout qualities in a smaller drier drinkable package simply put its really a great breakfast porter,0.597448133702712,0.9974
3828,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,amazing beer pours black with a nice beige cap and awesome lacing left on the glass especially for a big stout nose is dominated by rich roasted malts and coffee taste follows the nose but imho the dark chocolate flavors dominate the coffee body is fairly typical for the style as is the carbonation the abv is extremely well hidden for a 12 stout this is an amazing beer and my only wish is that i could have it more often,0.5974254403511168,0.9667
163,Mornin' Delight,an unbelievably huge thanks to chris for this one you are a saint sir thank you  batch 5  poured into a balloon stem at 45f  great big hiss when opened pours an inky coal black sitting like black coffee in the glass with just a hint of deep brown sheen on the top a collar of coffee bean bubbles form before quickly simmering down to nary a ring  nose i can smell this from across the table this thing is crazy a tsar boma explosion of maple galore like a canadian pancake house with an industrial sized syrup spill beneath that or rather beaneath that a big heaping batch of fresh ethiopian coffee  lightly roasty bold fresh and warming the actual beer base is just oozing with caramel brown sugar chocolate fudge vanilla cupcake frosting and a big rich nutty note with hazelnut spread and praline theres some dark fruit character but purely in the form of blueberry pie filling and candied plum a whisper of tiramisu cinnamon marzipan and fresh waffles this is a beautiful aroma  palate mornin delight greets the palate deliciously sweet  almost perfectly so and just unfurls with a maple intensity that is difficult to describe this is like rustic dark grade b maple syrup boiled down and barrelaged lending a sweet smoky maple fudge character and less like aunt jemima reported in batch 2 and batch 6 nevertheless this is still candied maple lending a parallel thread of pure butterscotch the coffee begins to open up and almost eclipses the maple lending a necessary roasty bean quality to cut through the sweetness the coffee is fresh smooth and bold with absolutely no acrid bitter charry or pepper qualities a dark chocolatecovered espresso bean note takes centre stage with a maple silhouette and some dried blueberry almond joy dark toffee and madagascar vanilla bean notes play in the background a nutty malt note emerges and the sweetness begins to rapidly subside  concluding with roasted malts hazelnut ethiopian coffee chocolate blueberries malted milk balls and the reminder of maple syrup just managing to dry out  mouthfeelbody tg did well here for how big and decadent this beer is it isnt syrup theres some very good effervescence for a 13 abv stout cutting through the full body rich hefty and creamy but not quite chewy or viscous it is quite sticky around the lips though the roast and coffee manages to lend just enough dryness in the finish to escape a cloying fate  mimicking very well the effect of oak tannins not difficult to drink  overall this has always been a hype stout and now i fully understand why it gets that praise in fact i think by and large it deserves it even ignoring the maple and coffee additions the stout itself is fantastic big sweet and so well rounded with some nice sweet blonde notes the fact that this is so rich sweet and hefty yet never fights back or feels like a chore is a testament to its pedigree you dont even care that it isnt barrelaged this is the real mccoy imperial breakfast stout  it just has that special something that separates it from the rest and i encourage any fan of the style to seek this out and try absolutely thrilled i got to enjoy this,0.5973744896701528,0.9994

3648,Heavy Mettle,101518 batch updated rating and review my prior rating was 47 this was the first trillium beer i ever had and it opened my eyes to the unique flavors that hops can impart on a beer  what a disappointment  a formerly magical and uniquely flavorful beer is now a heavy overly sweet and muddled mess  look is dark pour yields very little head a small ring remains  smell  surprisingly muted  very little tropical or juicy characteristic i almost get a rotten citrus smell  taste at once sticky sweet which this beer never was before despite its high abv and bitter  with this hop combo i expect that classic trillium magic and i could allow for a bit of hop burn but this is just sharp bitter and unpleasant to drink no single fruit characteristic comes to mind it feels like a huge mouthful of extra sweet jolly ranchers mixed with garlic cloves  it tastes thick chewy and muddled galaxy and columbus hops flavors are completely buried  feel harsh mouthcoating unpleasantness  surprisingly thin for such a high abv  if this is a result of the new fermentation profile this is a major disappointment and has confirmed that trilliums beers are no longer for me  never thought i would have such a strong opinion about a beer,0.5972920127996418,-0.3513

94,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,obsidian black with burnt motor oil brown edges at a closer look and very minimal visible carbonation but for a thin dark mocha ring that dies to a silky surface fairly quickly  smell is potent of cinnamon toast and red hots and lesser of vanilla nougat  the medium to thick body has a crackly fizz that firms up and brings out a more dusty cinnamon than on the nose while the barrel is splintery and adds some heat to the peppery sassafras of the oak that gives a hint of cola at times cocoa dusted dates comes out of the semidry warming finish as rounding chocolate and a smoky char continue to develop over top of the mild to low presence of spicy chili peppers  having this side by side a bottle regular abraxas of the same year the adjuncts seem like they have ten times the potency here by comparison its also not quite as thick or viscous as the ba sumps ive had,0.5952495161230164,0.5719
2834,Double Shot,drank from a 500 ml 1 pt 9 fl oz bottle purchased at tree house brewing company charlton ma served in a snifter  outstanding appearance an inchtall super tight and creamy mocha colored crown topped the oily pitch black body the head slowly dropped to a clingy collar large swaths of lacing coated the glass and stuck around until the drinks end  the aroma was coffee forward but not to the extent i was anticipating darker roast coffee perhaps big dark malt notes too moderately roasty there was an interesting savory quality as well bakers chocolate also came to mind  the flavor profile was was a total mocha bomb huge coffee presence medium roast creamed and sugared coffee specifically perhaps some coffee ice cream too hint of vanilla dark chocolate was also apparent brown sugar notes came through as well sweet but not excessively so there was a subtle booziness on the finish  outstanding soft creamy fluffy mouthfeel mediumfull bodied for the style the liquid contained a fine fairly zippy tongue blanketing effervescence  while many of the double shot variants are more impressive than this beer the original is still so good perhaps the best way to appreciate the wide range of offerings in this series is to occasionally revisit the beer where it began,0.595107359814879,0.9932
1233,Vanilla Bean Assassin,2019 vintage poured from a 12oz bottle into a stemmed taster glass pours inky black with virtually no head smells of chocolate cake with vanilla frosting dipped in bourbon one of the best smelling beers ive yet to encounter taste is similar with big chocolate cake and vanilla flavors with the whiskey barrel on the finish typical tg stout mouthfeel which is to say full bodied and nearly perfect for the style i am admittedly not a big straight vanilla stout guy but i was blown away with this beer the vanilla is integrated so well that i dont pick up on the dark fruit flavors that ive gotten with past assassins purple through green this is vanilla frosted bourbon cake in a glass delicious,0.5950734781010244,0.9243

1433,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,i will say this is probably the best barley wine i tasted it poured a dark murky brown  almost like prune juice but not in a bad way very little head probably due to high alcohol content the smell is just delicious  picked up notes of heavy dark fruits soaked in bourbon with oak toffee and vanilla more than what words can describe the taste was just outstanding  again tons of bourbon soaked dark fruits very sweet with notes of toffee and vanilla that became more prominent at room temperature the bourbon was up front from start to finish with a nice spiciness there is just a subtle hop bite but its pretty much a desert in the glass no alcohol warmth despite its ultra high abv content very fullbodied sticky and rich overall seek this out it will not disappoint because of its high alcohol content i was glad to share with a friend,0.5950313733598976,0.994

1968,Doppelganger,pours a hazy dirty straw color with over a finger of head the nose is predominantly dank with some piney notes in the background the flavor has notes of orange juice and grapefruit juice with a pithiness on the finish  this offering is super juicy but while the finish is hoppy it simply lacks the bitterness that i expect in a topshelf dipa its tasty interesting and worth trying once but i wouldnt make it a repeat purchase,0.5948972126146872,0.431
5229,Mother Of All Storms,pours a deep brown into the glass and therein appears essentially black save for the translucent brown edges a finger of creamy tan foam on top relaxes into a flimsy collar shortly after the pour aromas suggest bourbonsoaked dark fruits like plum prune raisin and fig on the sip similar fruity impressions blossom with a rich malt base and flavor elements of molasses and fruit breads drenched with booze the feel is full round and soft with a little bit of chewy fruit under a light air of vanilla and dark whiskey  this beer spent far too long on my wants list but it was every bit worth the wait  one of the best english barleywines out there highly recommended,0.5947683095757036,0.9555
2321,Breakfast Stout,pours a dark nonseethrough coffeeespresso with a moderate head that dissapates quickly but lingers on the glass  smell is that of coffee toffee and malt  taste is rich fullbodied and slightly sticky sweet with a bitterness that lingers on the palate for quite a while after each sip notes are similar to smell with coffee dark chocolate and toffee at the helm im not picking up on th oatmeal but it could be because the other flavors are dominant alcohol is hidden well at 83 but still noticeable  mouth feel is full bodied and syrupy but not sickeningly so  definitely drinking this one slowly  im really enjoying this stout flavors are all balanced nicely because its so heavy though this is one for enjoying on special occasions or as a meal replacement jk  would definitely recommend this one,0.5947575089423957,0.993
2307,Abricot Du Fermier,super vibrant orange almost neon with a persistent lumpy offwhite foam that settles to a thick collar and thin film  aroma has faint notes of various fruits like apple orange and apricot all on toast with some funk peppery oak and cheese thats kind of reminiscent of gose even with accents of seaweed and salt i also detect some pez towards the tail end of a whiff however as it warms the toast transitions to a breadiness that becomes completely overwhelming at the end of the session  having just had a full bottle of apricot casey family preserves that one tasted more fresh herbal and orchardlike adf is sharper more sour a little less fruit expressive but with a bit more oak the sourness nears vinegar at times but avoids it thankfully its also kind of orangey and grassy with some peach candy in the swallow finally funk is more present than caseys albeit lightly so  the medium body has a nice froth that fades to a crisp fizz this is super tingly and salivatingly tangy with a semidry finish but a slight burn on the way down increases the longer you go at it  batch 3 2018 vintage,0.5946995045047502,0.9609

3657,Heavy Mettle,sampling a cold 16 oz can poured into my snifter the beer pours a hazy orange color with creamy bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up and fading to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour is complete the aroma is the expected citrusy notes of orange and some grapefruit with also some fresh cut grass and a bit of pine sap and resin i get just a little bit of biscuity malt buried in the beer and the high abv is pretty well hidden on the nose the first sip reveals a silky texture with very fine and prickly carbonation the beer dries out intensely on the swallow but before that i experience a wide range of hop characteristics i get orange peel and grapefruit rind with some pine sap and again the fresh grass especially on the burps there is a bit of sweetness but not from malt more the citrusy fruit notes i get a bit of peppery alcohol bite on the swallow along with some warming in my belly but this beer could be consumed quickly which makes it a little dangerous at 93 quite a nice double neipa im glad i got to try this one and would do it again if trying to fulfill my hop needs some night,0.5943861646854685,0.9644
2362,Trappistes Rochefort 10,as is the trend with all the rocheforts this has a muddle turbid appearance with a slightly darker prune juice hue of brick red to brown under a moderate less active tan head thats softly convex settling to a densely blanket that retains well  aroma is more subtle and restrained but also mildly hoppy while taste follows suit in that it is far more drinkable than 8 despite its slightly stronger abv im getting notes of sticky toffee pudding with fig and mincemeat via a moderately light but silky body whose carbonation is tingly and fine but expandingly airy before coming to a semidry finish that has a slight prick of numbing heat a second visit brings a touch of molasses and ginger snaps with hints of caramelized brown sugar yet it remains slightly bitter by a lightly charred sort of element  this is a far more balanced brew with a more deft hand and clearlyaside from its strength which was probably a big deal in its daythis balance is what has kept its reputation so high,0.5943828177258667,0.592
2513,Bourbon Paradise,the beer pours the expected blackish brown color with good head retention and light lacing on the nose i pick up considerable dark chocolate coconut and vanilla with some underlying bourbon as well the flavor profile replicates the nose but im impressed by the richness and plush mouthfeel this beer is pretty sweet but the bourbon helps to counter that sweetness a bit even so this is very much a dessert beer and a sipper at that mouthfeel is soft creamy and full with a long finish alcohol is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile though you can tell the abv is up there a bit  impressive beer from the folks at prairie the sweetness is a bit much but otherwise its hard to find any flaws in this well crafted beer this is quite excellent,0.5943516948923454,0.9947

5872,Omega Point,a pours with barely a head even with a churning vigorous pour what little head forms doesnt retain very long and the pour appears more as a liquor in the glass once the foam is gone there is no lacing in the deep drown pour the pour itself is very hazy and has little to no red when held to the light  s there is a good combo of sweet scent components and barrel flavors right of the bat on the nose light peat scents and sweeter light brown sugar notes are prominent the barrel provides more of a scotch flavor to the scent than a bourbon flavors with the wood and peat being the strongest  t start off with a slight hint og dark fruits on the tongue that is quickly followed with notes of whiskey and peat malts the dark fruits and peat meld into a mildly dark malt flavor overall and lend themselves to the whiskey flavors of the barrel fairly well like in the scent the barrel component is more scotch than boubon in my opinion and as such lends to a more mild flavor that accentuates the peat malts lingering flavor is an intermingling of the barrel the malts and the dark fruits  m what this beer has in spades is a smooth and thick mouthfeel the beer itself drinks incredibly easily for a 10 abv imperial style and has a moderate level of carbonation  overall this beer is about average for the barrel aged barkeyline style it has a ton of scotchlike qualities which isnt necessarily my thing the dark fruit flavors are good and the barrel is noticeable but the smoothness of this beer is what is remarkable,0.5937700742270596,0.9029

1965,Triple Sunshine,canned 021919  l the beer pours a hazy golden with about a 1 cm white head the head recedes fairly quickly into a thin film leaving spotty lacing sthe nose is primarily a mix of pineapple and weedy dankness t up front there is some good bitterness of the grapefruit pithy variety as your palate adjusts to the bitterness the sweetness really comes on it is juicy sweet pineapple which lingers long after the bitterness relents alcohol is well hidden f the mouthfeel is medium overall but has a real syrupy quality which is enhanced by the sweetness of the beer carbonation is light but still keeps the beer from getting to heavy o a well executed triple the sweetness will keep some people from enjoying it but its certainly in line with other examples that ive had recommended for fans of triple ipas,0.5922991159053228,0.9723
5970,Smooth,notes from a recent bottle share  per my notes fruity as hell on the nose the nectarines are crazy juicy and strong with some light tartness and a decent dose of dry oak on the back end of the scent the pour is your basic side project fruited sour pour light a fizzy with little to no lacing or head this one is a beautiful full golden to moderately light orange in color on the tongue this one stings with a strong sour right up front the tartness is quickly subdued a bit with the emergence of great nectarine fruit flavor the stone fruit is still tart but juicy as hell to go along with it the back end mirrors the back of the scent with a very drying oak tartness the fruit lingers on the tongue well after the drink has ended just like the scent being typical side project the mouthfeel is as well it is highly carbonated and sticky with the fruit on the palate  overall this is probably my favorite of corys fruited sour small bottle series it is sour of course but not so bracingly sour as to outshine the fruit addition if you like any peachapricotorange sour beers this beer if definitely for you,0.5922649942847142,0.9422
2813,The Peach,appearance murky and cloudy bright yellow  aroma fresh ripe peaches very pleasant eventually smells like the jolly ranchers peach when it warms up the sourness is there but its like an afterthought  taste very sour upfront and then the peaches just works its way in noticeable at first but as it warms up its full blown fresh tart peaches one sip after another is really like taking a bite out of a peach but on top of that you add complexity as its highly sour i do not notice trace of oak or whatever it was aged in but thats okay its over abundant in peaches  mouthfeel medium bodied with a sour bite in the mouth  overall its definitely in the top 3 is sours ive tried i only wish i get to try this again,0.5921915590298162,0.9858
5423,Thicket,pours a light reddish brown body with slight pink hues half finger white head with surprisingly good retention time nice lacing smells of tart lactic acidity blackberry puree mild grainy malt sweetness in the background but make no mistake the acidity and the blackberry are the stars here although the blackberry is certainly playing second fiddle to the lacto and acetic acid flavour is surprisingly less sour than expected eg la fosse and the blackberries kick in towards the end for the most part its oak a bit of hay a lot of lactic and acetic acid contributing a strong sense of sourness the blackberries start to come into their own halfway in and leave you with a mild jammy flavour at the end the tartness never recedes but is rather constant still its a tasty beer and is far easier to drink than la fosse overall a very nice blackberry wild but it lacks a good bit of complexity for the most part its acidic with a moderate blackberry presence thats pretty much all she wrote,0.5921704412963247,0.9885
3888,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,2016 vintage black pour with a filmy beige head coffee leads the aroma persitent but not overwhelming taste starts sweet then the bitter coffee comes in barrel aging is evident at the finish both with woody notes and hints of bourbon latent heat 3 years on still great,0.5921614785749976,0.7876
4840,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,a dark gold orangeish color that ive only seen otherwise on mylar bags aroma was consistent with the taste which was a deep sweetness followed by a nice bracing bitterness very fruity and complex thick creamy feel as good as it gets at least the batch i had,0.592135691759891,0.7351
929,Fuzzy,375ml bottle into a teku blend 4 aka vintage 2020  a pops and is a gusher which is inexcusable as this has sat undisturbed for months several ounces wasted and sedimentation disturbed from the bottom color is apricot yelloworange with a fizzy white head that dissipates almost instantaneously once thats gone it actually looks flat its quite hazy nearly opaque certainly not much of a looker  s aroma is a great balance of fruit sweetness and tart sour characters huge fruit flesh characters with big peach as expected but also tangerine and apricot lactic acidity and sour citrus to balance i would say the tartsour characters are moderate on the nose a bit of melting plastic like funk and mineral notes round it out  t taste is very delicious much more sour than the nose with huge puckering tartness wonderful sweet fruit notes to balance its very orangefamily fruit forward with notes of oranges tangerines nectarines peace is primarily on the finish but is quite nice pretty big lemon tartness as well really fantastic  md mouthfeel is fuller bodied carbonation is appropriately high even though it looks flat in the glass drinkability is very good  o overall this is an excellent beer no doubt although 37 overall rating on ba seems damn high fair or not i always compare these american wild ales to traditional lambics and even very well done ones such as this tend to lack the depth and complexities of most offerings from the likes of 3f and cantillon regardless still a treat and would happily drink any day of the week  happy new year bas  354254754545,0.5921024699809699,0.9975

2475,Sunday Brunch,the pour is black with mahogany colors on the edges underneath a dense tan head the first note on the nose is rich coffee  wow this literally reminds me of brunch theres also a significant cinnamon component i am now officially salivating  the maple and cinnamon are more prominent on the taste which really elevates this imho because they are the perfect balance to the roasty coffee flavors and admit milk chocolate flavors to the imperial porter dance party kane has served up  the mouthfeel is a bit chewy which fits this beer perfectly this flavor profile chocolate coffee maple is popular and kane absolutely nailed this with the cinnamon addition,0.5917882964763257,0.9776

4503,Double Barrel Jesus,this is my personal white whale ive been trying to get my hands on this beer for years even more jesus is my favorite stout and ive been dying to try the ba version  this beer pours a thick darker than midnight jet black with a late forming dense dark brown with a tinge of maroon colored head it recedes quickly to a sliver of a ring around the edge of the glass and there are just a few spots of lacing  smell is chocolate fudge bourbon vanilla toffee brown sugar and sweet dark fruit  taste is the same starts of sweet but definitely not cloying with a nice mix of chocolate vanilla raisins and figs that transitions nicely into brown sugar and toffee mid sip and finishes with a wonderful blend of bourbon and oak  feel is thick decadent rich and velvety smooth with a slightly sticky finish very low carbonation which makes the body feel that much more full  overall an excellent beer the bourbon compliments the other flavors wonderfully and is not hot at all my one complaint is that the subtle smokey char that i love so much in emj is not present in the ba version still an awesome beer but i slightly prefer the original,0.5916948838992561,0.9947
2739,Blåbær Lambik,bottle i believe it to be 2015 poured a ruddy muddy purple almost wine like a purplepink frothiness that sits atop the beer aroma promises a very sour aspect to the beer earth vinegar wood and of course a mixture of ripe perfumey blueberries and underripe tart blueberries the flavor was probably not as complex as other cantillon beers i have had but it was surely impressive and flooring it starts off very tart a bright pop of sourness that has a balsamic quality folds into a display of woody blueberry wine i loved how dry it finished each sip was better than the last as my palate adjusted to the potency of flavor the body was light and the tartness lingered probably wont have this again so it was definitely a treat,0.59168333095182,0.9869

361,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,reviewing the apple brandyaged hunahpus imperial stout from cigar city brewing out of florida hunahpus is cigar citys most famous stout and it is released at an event that is essentially similar to dark lord day we cracked this one in addition to several other big name goodies to celebrate the end of the illinois bar exam my birthday and robbie moys birthday score 97  counterpressurized growler is from the summer 2012 release served in a wine chalice shared with friends and enjoyed on 072812 review is from notes  appearance pours a pitch black color with a nice layer of cappuccinocolored head that settles to a ring around the glass very oily coating lacing with a solid cling factor 45  smell what a delicious medley fudge and sweet dark chocolate impart a bittersweetness then brown sugar a little dark fruit and vanilla and a sweet rumlike aroma that must come from the apple brandy aging then tips the balance of the nose towards sweet the oak peppers and a hint of cinnamon then give the beer a nice spiced anchor to the sweetness theres a touch of booziness as the beer warms up but nothing powerful or offputting or overwhelming in the least this is a really excellent nose 4755  taste chocolatey fudge smooth vanilla and a sweet appleandwatermelonlike rum flavor almost like a smooth and less sugary bacardi grand melon flavor that is nothing like the offflavors being reported in some bottles of the 2012 vintage of dark lord are my first impressions there is a faint oakiness and chili pepper flavor at first on the sides of the tongue that modestly grows as the beer warms and layers on the tongue the apple brandy aging seems to have mellowed out the pepper heat substantially in comparison to the base beer but theres still a little bit of life left in the peppers and the smooth subtle heat they give off on the sides of the tongue and the roof of the mouth give the beer a nice bold complexity that makes the bitterness from the chocolatefudge flavors pop on the tongue the chocolate and rum sweetness really soak the tongue in flavor and linger with the faint pepper heat theres some mild dark fruit flavor and a hint of molasses as well though the aroma has more of each present 4755  mouthfeel rich thick and viscous full bodied and very low carbonation theres a faint pepper heat on the tongue slightly sweet but not a sweet beer 455  overall the balanced pepper kick is what made me really love hunahpus but even though it is largely missing here the apple brandy aging imparts more than enough additional complexity and flavor to make up for it i need to get some more  recommendation seek this beer out even those who are not good at handling spiciness i am looking at you scott should be able to enjoy this one thoroughly  pairings fresh strawberries  cost 25 for a 32 oz counterpressured growler,0.5916639271675659,0.995
5083,Barrel Aged Bomb!,12oz bottle poured into a snifter no date on the bottle but i know it is at least a few years old at this point  a black pour a little bit of a beige head struggles to form and ultimately fails little to no lacing not all that concerning for a barrel aged beer of its strength  s the chiles are much more forward on the nose than expected and thats the first whiff emanating from the glass heavy dose of roasty coffee next followed by a fat fudgey chocolate smell chocolate sauce and german chocolate cake roasted malt oak and whiskey come out more as it warms  t in taste its the massive tide of chocolate that hits first tons of hot fudge sauce chocolate truffles german chocolate cake fatty nibs etc lots of vanilla too mingling for a malted milkshake impression nutty and roasty coffee brings in a mocha flavor lots of whole chile taste too the heat is extremely mild but the flavor is big and rides to the forefront for a bit oak and whiskey are actually the quietest component surprisingly but that sweet whiskey flavor does round things out nicely smokey coffee and a tingle of chile heat on the finish  m rich in body with a bit of heft chewy and mouthcoating velvety low and gentle carbonation  o a bombastic beer overall and a bit of a roller coaster ride rather than melding into a cohesive whole each ingredient basically takes a turn reaching out and slapping you right in the palate its big sweet and straightforward even a little busy if im being honest thats not to say it isnt good on the contrary i really did enjoy it if youre a person who likes a nice pastry stout youll likely love it i think its a solid enough beer but its brutish approach and bold hedonistic flavors that vie for attention rather than coalescing cant touch the more carefully composed and elite barrelaged stouts very good but not great,0.5916414472076004,0.9947
56,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,this one pours a fairly dark black color with a small head and a little bit of lacing  this smells like heavy roast pepper spice rum spice cocoa powder oak dark fruit smoke and espresso  both barrels dont necessarily come through here  its more smokey rum than anything else im not sure i actually get any apple brandy theres a decent amount of pepper and a touch of cinnamon and a definite big helping of chocolate theres some tobacco and smoke too as is kind of common with this brewery theres a touch of molasses syrup on the back end too  this is medium bodied with a decent creaminess and no real booziness with a slightly bittersyrupy finish  this isnt anywhere near the height of the hype it used to get but its still enjoyable in a vacuum,0.5916303794229035,0.6877
1928,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,had a crowler of this over the summer shared with two other people  poured into a trillium tulipthis is one of the haziest most opaque beers ive ever seen bright yellow orange in color with a whiteoff white head that lingers looks sticky  aroma of grapefruit orange rind and tropical fruit abound not as assertive as i thought itd be but i find that some beers with insane hop amounts tend to be a touch muted on the nose  flavoris this orange juice stuff tasted like it it was like ddh congress on steroids so much orange and grapefruit mixed with tropical fruits nice lingering bitterness with a dry finish  feel on this was thick super creamy and sticky the lacing on the glass was impressive as it left a ring that stuck every single time i took a sip very filling though  overall this is one of the more memorable hop saturated beers ive ever had super in your face with flavor just tons of citrus and tropical fruit on the palate great beer,0.5916209681032758,0.98

1393,Supplication,the beer poured into a wine glass developed a quick settling head atop its murky copper hue the aroma was what i had been craving i was greeted with brett and some nice funk notes of oak fermenting red wine and an aroma that i can only describe as impending tartness there was also something fruity on the nose the first sip was very funky and dry the brett was on full display and not much else over the next few sips the beer came to life the funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak a bit of grain and an increasing amount of fruit this was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness a bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate this was simply exquisite,0.5907977303543744,0.4684

4558,Abraxas,2019 vintage 750ml bottle purchased off the shelf for 2449 i tried to let this get closer to room temperature before drinking it but it might still be kind of cold  look has a beautiful appearance viscous and black with a gorgeous albeit small brown head with nice lacing very compact thin foam with good retention really looks gorgeous  smell the nose on this beer suggests that it is decadence in a glass up front  chocolate galore rich dark bakers chocolate all of the adjuncts meld so well together with the imperial stout to create a fully integrated rich aroma the finish is warm cinnamon and vanilla its hard to pick out the ancho chile in the nose its a bit fruity on the front end so maybe that is coming from the ancho chile which foodies describe as a spicy raisin the aroma on this beer reminds me of a spiced chocolate cookie what i find so enticing about the aroma is that it has a creamy richness to it there is a nice nuttiness in the aroma also  reminds me of candied cinnamon almonds a touch of alcohol on the nose  taste its so tasty complex and delicious its really not very sweet yet from the list of adjuncts one might jump to call this a pastry stout very malty the flavor is reminiscent of ovaltine or an adult hot chocolate mexican hot chocolate flavors for sure the finish is bold and robust the slightly bitter roasted malt flavors linger long on my palate since the beer has such a full mouthfeel there is a bit of acidity on the finish and it works just fine here perhaps welcomed and there is warm spice on the finish from the cinnamon and ancho chile touch of black licorice on the finish as well  feel the mouthfeel is luscious this is the kind of thickness that imperial stout brewers dream to achieve carbonation is spot on  overall an extremely well made adjunct imperial stout you can tell that their base beer must be amazing adjuncts aside because the adjuncts can only enhance the base beer and cannot be used to cover up potential flaws 115 abv is extremely well hidden how do they achieve such a thick mouthfeel i used my champagne bottle stopper to store this back in the fridge for a day of two longerif i cannot drink it fast enough can i make a super delicious beer ice cream with it,0.5886451944533247,0.9986

1051,Doubleganger,average pour fills twothirds of a pint glass with deep tan foam takes some time to settle down enough to take a sip curiously not much stick to the lacing the liquid basically looks like you took a glass of apricot juice and stuck in the freezer impenetrable and immobile the nose packs a solid punch of dank herbaceousness roofing tar pine sap and thick sticky pineapple mango kiwi with some melon and peach in reserve not teasing out any citrus nor florality fullbodied without the help of the weakish carbonation manages nonetheless to develop nice momentum across the palate in turn while its juicy and damp at first there is a pleasing elevation in dryness at the end notes of brioche and challah bread pile on the mango papaya pineapple kiwi fruit intense fruit flavors vanilla ice cream touch pops up now and then still barely registering any citrus pink grapefruit if anything on the whole it tastes awfully like a confection dessert scores points for sheer bombast but id be hard pressed to see anyone easily put back two cans of it in a row its that tiring canned 73021,0.5880916658265384,0.7251
4992,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,great looking and smells amazing taste is nicely tropical but a bit boozy and vegetal mouthfeel is warm nicely bitter chewy while this beer improves as i get further into the glass increasing my initial rating for taste mouthfeel and overall by 025 each i am a bit disappointed honestly i wish the warmth and vegetal nature from the hops were absent they decreased with time but are still present though the beer is warm it is still not hugely so considering the abv overall pretty good but not better than the original king sue,0.5880852541744812,0.9832

3728,Double Stack,a pitch black pour with virtually no last head just a thin ring of brown and offwhite foam around the rim of the glass the nose is intensely floral with a concentrated maple syrup aroma i love that smell and i cant stop sniffing it the drinking hits with big waves of lovely chocolate malt upfront the mouth feel is very noticeable with just a thick and full bodied feel that really coats the mouth and lingers well after each sip despite the nose the main flavor on the drinking is the coffee big and roasted coffee grinds that finish nicely bitter im mostly getting the syrup note on the finish but its very pleasant and not nearly as sweet as i had anticipated it to be or what the nose suggests additional notes of caramel brown sugar smoke charred oak burnt toast vanilla and molasses despite its feel and abv the brew is super drinkable and im starting to feel it  overall wow just fucking wow i love everything about this beer its big and brash but yet very refined with some many flavors going on this is why the nbs bif is so worth it a borderline 5 for me players i could drink buckets of this,0.5880521989118151,0.9889
3774,Society & Solitude #6,so the beer pours a rich looking apricot amber color with pretty decent head retention and light lacing on the nose theres a huge aroma of mango papaya apricot and pineapple the mosaic hop presence is pretty pronounced in this bad boy the flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely but the tropical fruit flavor wasnt as intense as i was expecting mouthfeel was also a bit less full than i was expecting though i appreciate the fairly light dry and moderately bitter finish in this beer the finish is very clean in this beer and the alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile so drinkability is pretty good this is a very good dipa for sure though i dont think it quite matches up with the 7 version i tried last night however i think a bit more sweetness and richness on the palate would improve this dipa immensely  still a very good beer from the folks at hf,0.5879879122075254,0.9929

2045,Black Note Stout,pretty high bar to set describing it as sharing qualities with expedition and the feel of double cream also a beer that ive long wanted to try but my first experience largely lived up to the high billing  jet black body with colabrown edges not as viscous or thick as i expected but its certainly a big and bold looking stout handsome mocha cap of latte head that collapses quite quickly but leaves a strong circumferential ring of chocolate foam that provides spotty lacing down the glass swirls of the glass produce moderate alcohol legs and renewed mocha film that compliments the jet black coloring extremely well  the aroma and taste profile is as expected with huge bursts of dark chocolate roasty and toasty malts divine dark fruits exotic woods licorice brown sugar and barrel char the nose is masterfully layered with no single note dominating and each whiff leading with something different on the tongue you get an added streak of whiskey heat and molasses sweetness with strong barrel personality  toffee oak and a little maple  standing out theres perhaps just a tad too much black licorice for my liking but thats pretty nitpicky its not a sweet stout at all but the semisweetness and strong bitterness balance each other out beautifully  feel is thinner than i expected and was hoping for especially given the double cream reference but its incredibly smooth and silky with just a wee bit of stickiness reasonably carbonated and very little boozy heat,0.5868380794992055,0.9945

745,Duck Duck Gooze,review number 1000 and also beer advocate beer number 1600  thanks to eyebereej for sending this bottle 2013 bottling consumed on dec 18 2016 reviewed from notes poured from the 750 ml bottle into an el catador barrel aged glass  a pours a hazy glowing gold forms a thin white head that fades quickly with a relatively low amount of visible carbonation this isnt badlooking by any stretch but appears fairly still i dont know if thats a consequence of aging or not  s earthy and funky barnyard oaky dry tannins and notes of stone fruits especially apricot though i dont think this thats actually in there some lactic tartness and light biscuit malts in the background im getting more lacto funk primarily with lesser brett notes a really nice complex aroma  t lactic tartness and more sour juicy stone fruits like a dried apricot earthy funk again  lacto again and some pedio i think dry citric acid and tannins the light biscuit malts are still getting snowed under here  it was necessary to search for them some dry white wine character it finishes with some stone fruity juiciness and a drying sourness and the dry flavors ultimately win out  m light body very low alcohol presence carbonation sensation is just a bit on the low side  o wowafter sitting for three years this lives up to both the hype and my expectations and both of those were quite high especially as a nonfruited nonadjuncted sour it succeeds with a complex and balanced funk and sourness i guess you could argue provenance visavis the authentic gueuzes of the world but this absolutely could stand on its own in the conversation,0.5861847444735797,0.8793
1378,Aaron,opaque chestnut brown with a moderate fuzzy tan blanket that slowly settles to the thinnest ring and a smooth slick surface a tilt leaves an impressive span of clear legs on the glass  the aroma has swirls of vanilla and caramel even as the glass sits further away coming in close charred oak and aged date pair with toffee and a distinctly mapleesque bourbon warmth  taste is just as sweet and decadent as the nose sounds belly warming caramel frosting is lifted by jack and cokeit sounds odd and maybe offputting but its light on the palate helping its drinkability heavier notes of dark fruit and vanilla marshmallow fluff are again countered by sweet light and even floral fig which all begins to transform into fresh coconut on the exhale especially as it warms  tingly and even crisp the medium body is really easy to drink for a big burly barleywine its even inexplicably fleeting disappearing into a slightly numbing lightly sticky semidry finish leaving you desperately craving another swig obviously i like this a lot but at the same time feel like i cant quite grasp it theres something unsatisfying that leaves you wanting and maybe thats the beauty of it,0.5861824216191827,0.9831
3890,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,appearance the beer was silky black in appearance with a slight head of offwhite bubbles  smell  darker notes came from the notes with coffee and chocolate leading the way  taste  my initial impression was fudge flavored iced coffee the coffee notes were dark but not bitter there was a light burn of bourbon toward the back the fudge notes were able to linger for quite some time  mouthfeel  the beer was very full bodied for an oatmeal stout it was not quite a russian imperial stout in feel but it had viscosity the smoothness of the pour allowed the delicious fudge notes to hover on the tongue for quite some time  overall  i definitely enjoyed this beer on a cold summer night,0.5861564297216717,0.9666

4770,Last Snow,the aroma is downright intoxicating when it comes to coconut qualities  this really does smell like a liquefied mounds bar coffee roasted malt and of course dark chocolate all offer a nice ballast to the coconut one niggle the additions are so bold they overpower the porter backbone somewhat this beer is a total showstopper on the taste budswell at least for the first few sips apart from a slightly roasted opening coconut utterly dominates in the bestworst way around the middle and end coffee plays second fiddle to the coconut flavors just like the aroma indicated speaking of how it ends the finish comes across like this coconut coffee porter had three tons of table sugar clumsily added to it  theres that so sweet its somehow bitter sensation i get from a select few dessert beers like creme brulee from southern tieror maple bacon coffee porter from funky buddha themselves at the end of the day the actual flavor of this beer is a total letdown next to the awesome nose plus it feels thin and angular  not a good combination with the extreme levels of sweetness said extreme sweetness ultimately chokes the drinkability factor carbonation is medium high i do enjoy this more than their maple bacon coffee porter but eh i dont need to have this again either way  3245 syrupy and absurdly sweet  perfect for the hypetrain crowd,0.5845800230044184,0.974

769,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,probably my favorite of the speedway coffee variants  the beer pours a blackish brown color with pretty good head retention and lacing the beer looks rich and viscous which aint no bad thing on the nose there is considerable coffee and vanilla along with underlying dark chocolate and perhaps a hint of cinnamon the flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely and while this stout is pretty sweet the coffee flavor seems to balance and counter that sweetness somewhat theres a mocha quality on the palate of this beer that i just love mouthfeel is full soft and fairly creamy with a very long finish alcohol is incredibly well integrated into the flavor profile and so drinkability is terrific almost too terrific as its hard to show restraint where this beer is concerned  just outstanding and a beer i would order and even make a special trip to obtain whenever i see it on tap around portland which is pretty infrequent unfortunately,0.5844582374745926,0.9921

5930,Peche 'n Brett,pretty damn good beer a masterful blend of tart and sweet in which you can actually taste peach instead of an indiscernible fruit flavor like a lot of other beers its light crisp a little dry decently carbonated and has just the right amount of funk not the cheapest bottle but if you come across it worth an indulgence,0.5843413855825466,0.743
1541,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),aged bottle jet black with hints of brown shading brown cap this one is more fitting of the dark lord moniker as it doesnt hold anything back huge bourbon booze starts the nose with chocolate fudge roasted malt coffee solid rustic oak molasses dried dark fruit and vanilla taste is much the same as the nose but not as nuanced barrel stays strong vanilla steps up caramel enters in dark fruit fades away feel is big boozy and dark just what they are going for even with some age it still bites im sure this will be controversial but i like the nonba version better as an all around ris but when in the mood for a beast of a beer this will suffice tough certainly on the sweeter end,0.5843351139496205,0.9485

4143,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,shimmering burnt honey amber with a large fuzzy white foam that clings in very large ridges  this 4 or more year old blend is very crackery and toasty of sesame seed character with a super mature mild sourness that at first contributes lemon grapefruit and complex spicy funk that is far more balanced and mellow than a younger blend might be as it comes to temperature cracked black pepper and apple cider develop bringing this to a very comforting old world delight  golden blend has a medium body with a light froth and a tingly dry finish  what a fantastic brew    having a blend 37 from season 1920 in september 2021 im finding this mindblowingly startlingly clean this is relative not just to any old 3f gueuze but even to my past review of golden blendof which im not sure the vintage but it was definitely a paper labeled 375  its just insanely clean and fluffyand brightexhibiting characteristics of apricot white wine and pear its as if fruited by white wine grapes while far less acidic than you would expect from a fruited 3f and clearly its not actually fruited still its all the white grapes  i cant get over its super drinkability my 436 score is getting upped,0.5842645724046809,0.976
2639,Last Buffalo In The Park,on tap medium tan ring by the time it gets to me some lacing above the slowly dropping black bodys surface  the coconut is prevalent early but not overpowering rich coffee notes provide the counter to this theres a little caramel to toffee sweetness sneaking in as it warms pushing the coconut aside much more than the coffee  taste starts with that caramel note not too strongly sweet the coffee barrels no pun intended in and makes the opening note seem more like a splash of flavored cream added to it the coconut hits at the edges with a bit of alcohol bite  almost like rumsoaked coconut moderate heft with a slightly sticky feel countered by a fairly aggressive carbonation  a very nice balance of the ingredients without giving into them the coffee boosts the stout for a strong base and the accents fill in with a little flair,0.5842278605569228,0.9092

503,Zenne Y Frontera,having this season 1819 blend 92 sidebyside with regular oude geuze season 1819 blend 69 for maximum contrast zenne is a much darker amber with a short khaki head that settles to a thin offwhite ring  the nose is nougat and nutty dusty musty walnut to the nth degree  taste exhibits sweet honey and caramel characteristics and upon intermingling with the sherry barrels this emulates a caramel apple and even mulled cider all while maintaining starkly savory notes attributed to the barrel this puppy is dry af and also a bit more acidic than og yet simultaneously more complex especially as it warms even still it maintains in the background those classic toasted cracker and grapefruity 3f properties  as mentioned the contrast between regular og and this is astounding while the oude geuze is simply more drinkable effervescent and lightly brightly clean i can see how a brew like this stands out from the crowd and makes a very uniquely intriguing impression at the same time i cant imagine solo doming a whole bottle of this its just so complex sharing is the move here,0.583384520478877,0.959

4011,The Abyss,wow that is a powerful smell its a combination of wood cocoa licorice and alcohol but mostly the cocoa wood  ok the wood and dark chocolate come through first and then deep pungent bitterness   its a full bodied stout  there is carbonation but it barely cuts through the thickness the alcohol is warming it finishes dry and bitter  its fantastic if you want an extremely powerful stout without a hint of whiskey this couldnt be more perfect it gets a 58 out of 6 not a perfect score because its almost overpowering but still great,0.5833700930336118,0.8666

1823,Swish,appearance  the beer poured with the appearance of orange juice with no pulp and a bubbly white head  smell  the nose was composed of orange juice the leaned more bitter than the average hazy  taste  orange rind led the way which kept the beer from being overly sweet a spiciness followed that caused a light warming sensation the overall profile had a nice sense of balance it was sweet but not loaded with added junk  mouthfeel  the haziness paralleled a thick body it was not quite drinking juice without pulp but it was thick  overall  this is a great example of the style that is not overdone,0.5825099977445851,0.8483

6082,Blanc De Blancs,acts exactly like champagne foams up immediately recedes quickly bubbles rising from nucleation sites on the bottom of the glass crazy musty aromas with a moscatolike sweetness between the musty funk and sweet white wine aromas the jawaching tartness from the first sip is a bit of a shock the 10 is front and center with tons of white wine funk barrel and a dry as a bone finish,0.5818838597606253,0.7096

386,Assassin,2019 vintage silver wax  this one pours a very dark black color with a small head and not much lacing  this smells like dark chocolate fudge oak spice nuttiness caramel tobacco smoke and vanilla  im not sure this is worth the exorbitant secondary price that it commands but its certainly a very well executed barrel aged stout the barrel character is very well done and its a surprisingly dry and non pastry take theres tobacco roast oak spice caramel and well integrated bourbon along with vanilla deep dark chocolate fudge some fruitiness brownies and espresso  this is medium bodied and not very boozy with a good drinkability for what this is i could imagine this wouldnt be that hard to solo dome if you really wanted to do that  i have no frame of reference to say if this stands up to the earlier and more legendary batches of this beer but i have to say that i really enjoyed it,0.5816831351961004,0.9747
1527,Citra,from a can with a couple weeks on it into snifter pours copper in color somewhat muddy  piney resinous extremely hoppy but not well balanced with a malty backbone little alcohol burn but not overly flavorful astringent reminds me of the classic overly hoppy west coast hop bombs but not as good  i dont know still really like a classic west coast ipa but this one just doesnt do much for me glad i was finally able to try it even if it was ultimately disappointing,0.5816558810445839,-0.236

2839,Double Shot,very pretty pour thick black and fizzy with a retentive chocolate brown head  smells like chocolate vanilla cake but somehow without any ersatz or cloying nodes lots of brewers have recently resorted to gimmickery to make their beers taste like pastriespouring frosting and moon pies into the mash etc this is old fashioned coffee stout sweetness and its done to a motherfucking t  tastes very nearly as good as it smells chocolate and vanilla up front moving into more of a traditional dry coffee stout in the middle with bittersour barley balancing out the sweeter flavors and the finish is a wonderful combination of mocha vanilla and barley  overall this is a worldclass beer thats absolutely worth seeking it if the body were just a wee bit thicker i would have considered it perfect but thats just me a score of 5 for double shot is fully warranted,0.5815599305623259,0.979

4915,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,2019 bottle 12oz 11 abv  the pour is dark and viscous poured cold so allowed room to warm so not much of any rising head or visible carbonation a thin beige ring surrounds the top of the beer in the glass  a huge chocolatey aroma reminds me of brownie batter with a nice underlying complexity of molasses and dark fruit theres a roasty malt character to this as well but that initial chocolate dessert sweetness really wins the day on the nose  a fantast contrast in the flavor profile brings out a ton of barrel character as well as a much stronger emergence of those dark fruits and molasses characteristics the barrel brings out additional flavors of vanilla oak and bourbon and roasty dark coffee begins to grab a good bit of influence as well as it warms further in the finish its all bourbon with a familiar boozy spice on the tail  warming smooth viscous as it slips down the back theres a good level of residual mouthcoating and does well to accompany a boozy burn down the hatch definitely would consider a fullbodied beer and drinks like more of a 14 ba stout in all the best ways possible,0.5814676922209788,0.9946

4258,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),a relatively gentle pour into a tulip still resulted in loads and loads of fizzy beige colored head with some decent lacing this is a very active beer in the glass after 5 minutes the head is still almost an inch thick and continues to be actively reinforced by the carbonation from below color is dark cola brown with a nice reddish tinge aroma is malty and sweet with a hint of alcohol  taste has a wonderful balance of sweet malts but with a nice dry finish theres a complexity to this that i just cant place but whatever those tastes are theyre working very well together for me the feel really shines medium bodied plenty of carbonation but not overdone and smooth in a way that really hides the alcohol very well done beer,0.5814137915589498,0.9534

5474,Coconut B-Bomb,sitting on my back deck in the cold last vestiges of winter i have a couple more cellaring so figured to try this before the warm weather hits consistently 2018 bomber poured cellar temp to a tulip glass nose is subtle vanilla bourbon light toastiness color is black which pours with a three finger mocha head that burns fast to a ring with lots of lacing first sips follow the nose but with stronger bourbon more toasty coconutand barrel balanced impeccably slightly sweet with a full creamy mouthfeel alcohol hides well but has a slight warming later excellent base stout flavors not sure it will warm up considering its about 30 degrees on the deck buy it when you see it,0.5813048486176555,0.944
5384,Very HHHazyyy,canned 81121 be good to each other stamped on the bottom of the can some words to live by these days  here it is the final  evolution of tree houses haze series at least at the time being ive been outspoken in the past about thinking that haze is one of their lower tier beers though still quite good in the field of below average fruit bomb neipas very hazy was a marked improvement over the original so im hoping to keep the upward trend going with this one lets see just how hazy it is  pours a hazy radiant gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves nice lacing  it is certainly like a fruit cocktail in the nose evocative of a scorpion bowl at an asian restaurant im picking up on aromas of orange juice dank mango pineapple juice maraschino cherry peppery hops a touch of spruce and bready malt to round it out  this hits a different region of the th ipa game falling more into the earthy and malty category rather than aggressively fruity and it works out quite nice for this one on the front end of the sip im tasting fresh cut grass pineapple juice orange pith and doughy malt the swallow brings notes of pithy grapefruit doughy malt juicy peach juniper berry peppery hops and a creeping long finish of bananas foster to bring it back around to the sweet aroma  a medium full body pairs with very gentle carbonation resulting in a creamy and thick beer finishes off dry with an herbal character that nearly takes over  this is one hell of a unique one for tree house and it is very good easily one of my favorite beers from them thus far such a huge improvement over haze one which i was not expecting,0.5812567194269586,0.9862
1147,V.S.O.J.,pours an almost entirely opaque brown with tinges of light coming through at the edges with a big light tan head that dissipates slowly  aromas of dark fruits leather raisins slightly dried prunes fig caramel and toffee dominate subtle undertones of vanilla oak brown sugar cocoa and coffee follow all the immense complexity that one would hope for in an english barleywine is present and then theres an extra step above in every aspect only a slightly over the top boozy aroma keeps this from being perfect and even that isnt unwelcome truly delightful  the taste is more of the same deep complexity with rich dark fruits leather cocoa powder vanilla and oak playing the most prominent roles toffee and molasses also are big players here and theres a hint of coffee as well  it has a velvety mouth feel thick rich and coating it hides the booze well for being 14 but it still lets you know its there with a tinge of alcohol burn on the end  this is a world class english barleywine incredibly complex while retaining a perfect balance between the aromas and flavors this is just wonderfully executed and i hope to be able to drink this many more times in the future,0.5812341345446117,0.975
282,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),wow that is a tasty brew a very solid beer from a giant in the game neglected vehicle motor oil esque color tan head smell not overwhelming honestly might be due to low carbonation i would classify this as a tastefully flavored stout not some pastry flavored amalgamation marketed to hipsters not much chocolate if anything more of a milk chocolate flavor as opposed to the dark chocolate stout one is accustomed to kinda bizarre as i dont think this beer has lactose little coffee maple becomes more present as i get deeper into the beer probably most prominent flavor very homemade chocolate pancake with a lil edge hungover ihop and a cigarette mouth feel is thick but not so thick this beer is a chore to drink really no heat from the booze overall as i have evolved as a beer drinker this style isnt something i crave but rather have as a treat the sweetness is a lil much to drink these often along with how much booze is in it but for style this beer is pretty excellent,0.5812308002528388,0.9461

5940,Peche 'n Brett,bottle date best by august 2022 palate contaminants none  color is light gold opaque glow fair amount of fine head  the smell has both citrus acidity and some lactic element the peach blends well with that acidity it doesnt hang around as long as id like  very light funkiness in the taste sometimes i get a candy taste and for this one its smarties moderate bitterness the peach is diminished from what was on the nose slight honey and plums as it warms i hope i didnt wait too long to consume this one on second thought the bottle does say that the ideal serving temp is 5065 and i am noticing more intensity as it warms  carbonation is plenty prickly alcohol is very well hidden for a tenner theres more sweetness in the aftertaste than in the taste moderate astringency,0.5797412023022052,0.9761

5525,Juicy,375 ml bottle from december 2016 obtained in a trade hope its still good as it certainly was well cared for  l maybe 1f head poured into behind the veil teku glass not much retention no lacing only a thing ring beer is a very attractive clear deep copper  s definitely getting a lot of the wine barrel guessing chardonnay and brett some grapefruit and lemon maybe  t tart wine and wine barrel up front with slightly sour citrus in the form of lemon and grapefruit along with the brett intense flavors for sure so the name is apt still has a spicy crispness even with some age so im guessing the taste is as intended finish does linger despite the crispness and it comes close to running away on the tart side abv not really evident  f light to medium bodied mediumish carbonation crispy but palate doesnt dry completely allowing for a long tart finish good construction  o would like to try fresh for parallel tasting but for now this falls a tiny bit behind brother soigne on my list of hf saisons as always i believe the water is what makes all of their offerings so good,0.5796726940810918,0.9824

3505,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,this was a significant improvement on the base beer like the base it tastes of licorice raisins and almonds some chocolate comes through as well its very rich on the nose and flavor the base tastes course and artificial to me but the bourbon barrel helps to smooth that out i get a little vanilla from the barrel and i really like how the bourbon integrates with the base beer the bourbon flavor is pleasant without excess booziness the mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium and there is a little chalkiness that detracts from the feel overall its a very good beer with a few flaws,0.5795900221308768,0.9718
562,Abner,pour like most cloudier ipas but it isnt murky at all which is nice has a lingering opaque head no lacing but that could be the pour since this beer usually has some nice lacing smell is fruit mainly citrus lemon and orange to me taste follows same sweeter citrus tangerine clementine sweeter orange cara cara if you havent tried one do it youll thank me it finishes with a grapefruit bite what separates this beer from other hazy beers is that it is not thick and cloying or heavy at all it finishes pretty dry too and has a soft bitterness that is very pleasant and goes well with it glad i get to drink this guy once a year always an enjoyable experience,0.5795798479411278,0.9793

1891,Chocolate Rain,2013 vintage drank 020521  look  black with a brown twinge  smell  very strong chocolate tobacco and bourbon barrel as it warmed up the aroma really came through  taste  wow this was better than expected chocolate fudge anise and a heavy barrel presence at 18 it hides the alcohol really well its there but ive had 10 beers that are more boozy awesome after dinner sipper  feel  a little thin but its from 2013 actually not nearly as bad as expected  overall  this was a pleasant surprise being from 2013 this beer has held up very well really smooth bourbon barrel chocolatey stout enjoyed this more than its base black tuesday those cocoa nibs must add something special,0.5794792440602321,0.9896
5501,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,it looks motor oil thick and used motor oil black and shiny in the glass minimal dark tan head rests on top and quickly diffuses into spotty islands of lace and a thin ring around the aroma is huge vanilla oak bourbon and dark bakers chocolate taste is ahmayzeing super rich dark chocolate is the first thing that hits me followed by some tobacco vanilla oak a little coffee and some slight bourbon heat on the finish mouthfeel is a little thinner than i expected but still on the full side of medium oily slick coating my mouth at all angles with a dry finish but not chalky overall this is fantastic and every bit worthy of its high marks,0.579477732916922,0.9387
2935,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,description appearance is jet black like the normal speedway with little to no head smell is full of oak but not so much bourbon coffee dark chocolate and roasty notes are also apparent the woodiness of the oak really comes through on the taste and adds a lot of earthiness to the beer taste is not as coffee heavy as the smell feel is more like a porter in that its a little light for a stout minimal carbonation and smooth drinking  suggested food pairing bbq ribs  if you like this beer then you should also try kbs  overall 45 this beer is very good and i would definitely have it again this is certainly a great derivative of an already stellar brew feel is a little thin and it could use more bourbon flavor but this is an all around fantastic beer,0.5794738548866791,0.9858
3436,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,pours dark yellow smells of hops like a typical new england ipa solid beer but reminds me a lot of some of the other ipas ive already had i think the addition of lupulin powder adds nuance to the typical hop profile,0.5794722378677925,0.2617
5551,Birth Of Tragedy,pours black with tan head theres some barrel aroma vanilla and booze it really is super balanced delicate and well finessed the honey seems to subdue the barrel character or at least keep it from being as heavy handed as some other bba stouts theres some chocolate in there too its super smooth to the point where the bourbon punch is a pinch bot is just a phenomenal porter,0.5794663493523569,0.8854

999,Chemtrailmix,first beer i had at dark lord day 2018 sampled multiple times throughout the course of the day as well on draft and poured into plastic cups which were then poured into my glass standard dark lord body not much to be said about that smell is a massive cinnamon slight spicy rye brown sugar a bit of burnt black coffee a bit of umami milk chocolate recognizably dark lord underneath the flavour is a bit more muddled but the cinnamon remains huge from the beginning to the end contributing that cinnamon toasted crunch up front intermingling with the dl base and combining well with the spicy rye barrel to bring more of a spice component on the backend peppercorns arent as prominent as in 2017 which is a good thing mouthfeel is full bodied good carbonation smooth and slightly silky cinnamon spice on the finish this is on the level of ba abraxas in terms of the cinnamon without the green pepper from the spices i can see this one being the variant of the year,0.5794145003676233,0.9083
3167,Great,on tap at toronado sd left over from beer week into a tulip  leathermahogany in color viscous complexion dampens any attempt at a head nose is buttery bourbon floral malts burnt sugar and a good dose of oak its flavors follow with a lot more boozy warmth at the front of the sip  super tasty smooth barleywine from my understanding this was almost an accident and its not quite as tasty as i remember it before green flash took things over but still,0.5793767594988608,0.5615

1781,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,kuhnhenn  man i really had no idea what is going on up there in michigan so many fantastic breweries  fourth dementia pours a deep oily brownblack  it looks incredibly viscous and syrupy while the smell is all warm malty sweetness  i gave this some time to reach room temperature on a first taste the sweetness really took me by surprise its incredibly rich and cloying almost syrupy  excellent texture with a delicious toffee caramel marshmallow taste to it again very very sweet  but its so smooth and disguises the abv so well that the sweetness doesnt bother also slightly surprising  im accustomed to some sort of unpleasant aftertaste with a beer that is so incredibly sweet but 4th d is exceptionally clean  this is a fantastic beer im generally one to avoid old ales  but this particular bottle was part of an lif from flintb so i couldnt say no tremendously delicious bottle  thanks again flintb,0.5792862744478017,0.9855
3582,No Rules,pour is black leaking to dark mahogany on the edges and a tan head huuuuge barrel notes up front then oak and coconut aromas follow  the barrel is prominent on the taste but the oak and coconut mellow it a bit the star of the show though is the turbinado sugar which adds sweetness duh to the beer but also depth and balance that really elevates this,0.5792861975957038,0.714
4987,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,simply wow  an amazing beer great balance and even more great taste peach orangetangerine mango pineapple for a beer that is 78 this one is very easy drinking,0.579207055737643,0.9652

3993,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,i found this variation to obviously be of the same commendable quality as plain bamc but a bit sweeter with a touch more raisin i didnt really get the smoky caramelized maple flavor i was hoping for but hey cant complain about getting another version of barrel aged mexican cake it still has that distinct spicy heat with a slick thin body that finishes semidry,0.5790406376375854,0.748
575,Double Sunshine,quick review can purchased at brewery mostly clear with strong lacing nose is a bit light fruity taste starts a little sweet with a hint of burn but balances quickly and then slowly becomes bitter the transition is nice only mild complaint is i wish is started just a little less bite awesome beer and im mostly finding smaller detractions to bring it down from perfect,0.5789537119473138,0.9472
4448,Hold On To Sunshine,a very tasty stout theres a hint of peanut butter here but coffee is still the dominant smellflavor its got a nice balance of sweetness and bitterness and i liked the mouthfeel which was rich and creamy but not overheavy and syrupy i also liked the abundance of dark brown foam on this beer edit although a recent batch from 91620 was much less carbonated i think i like the double shottriple shot varieties better than this and i liked fleeting moment better too but this was another very enjoyable stout from tree house,0.5789530459037999,0.991
5969,Smooth,huge upfront acidity while cold with a nice sweet juicy feel as it gets closer to room temperature i wouldnt exactly call this a fruit or a tart bomb but runs a nice balance of both,0.5789163122233403,0.7311

6073,Black & Wild,750ml bottle batch 1 served in a side project stemmed glass on 5102015  appearance is pitch black perfectly contrasts with the side project lightbulb logo beautiful two finger brown head with appropriate retention time disappears into a very thin collar no film no lacing  smells of tart cherries up front fresh out of the fridge it doesnt smell as sour as i was expecting it to be after one year in the bottle moderately acidic but not vinegary or lactic after a few minutes thick chocolate fudge comes out literally like chocolate fondue the cherries are still strong at this point making for a nice chocolate covered cherry aroma oak a bit of vanilla the whiskey starts coming out more as it warms as well smoky sweet robust whiskey a nice complement never quite emerging to the fore overall to sum up the full extent of the aroma in one sentence tart cherries covered in dark chocolate with a bit of vanilla essence and oak mellow whiskey in the background fair amount of acidity but not particularly lactic  flavour is equally complex initially tart cherries dark chocolate so like in the nose chocolate covered cherries not particularly sweet small amounts of vanilla are present as is a moderate vinegary acidity as it warms up the oak and tannins seem to combine with the acidity to give a vinous flavour like a syrah in my mind it seems to impart a lot of red wine notes into the flavour i suspect this is due to the combination of the oak tannins and the acidity whiskey is there underneath all of this no heat but a subtle char is noticeable towards the end a very complex beer that seems to evolve with minute changes in temperature finally reaching its peak at room temperature even more cherries come out at the end its really a fascinating drinking experience  the body is rich and substantial which youd think would be strange for an awa but its substantial without being dry or creamy smooth with good carbonation different flavours follow each other in waves as they roll over your tongue leaving a pleasantly tart oaky and mildly sticky aftertaste without any kind of heat  overall this is one of the more unique beers ive had the pleasure of drinking over the last 3 years when i think about american wild ales and how they compare to their old world counterparts i tend to find that most heralded examples of wild ales seem to be lacking in complexity by being so boldly acidic cory king has somehow taken the genre to another level by creating a beer that is bold in every way with plenty of acidity yet nuanced with a great array of different flavours that make each sip a new experience in of itself    750ml bottle of batch 2 served in a wine glass  pours a dark black body with a hint of brown depending on the lighting one finger tan head that dissipates fairly quickly not altogether too different from the original batch smells of dark chocolate cherries oak vinegar fudge the level of acidity you can smell and taste is remarkably similar to oneyear old batch 1 as above which surprised me flavour is very similar chocolate fudge and chocolate covered cherries oak vinegar the cherries arent as prominent as expected the flavours pop nicely with a nice tart 810 acidity that is quite sour but not bracingly so no off flavours as the beer warms it brings out a little more of the chocolate and less of the cherries it evolves quite a bit just like its predecessor did delicious mouthfeel is noticeably thinner than the original batch i felt there is still a fair amount of body but perhaps i am comparing everything to maman which i had the same day good carbonation with a nice residual slightly fizzy chocolate fudge and acidity on the backend overall its not quite batch 1 as far as body goes but the flavour remains excellent and one of the more unique beers ive had,0.5787969715073804,0.9989
144,Pliny The Younger,l orange opaque but not hazy less than a finger white head s pine some citrus hop resin t huge hit of pine up front there is some citrus this does hide the abv well finishes smooth and dry f good carb level with a light to medium body o this is a great west coast ipa it is very similar to the elder but it does finish a little smoother with slightly more citrus,0.5787610808772251,0.9437

5250,Sosus,packaged 82020 not even a month old  pours out a clean and clear looking yellow in the glass its a mildly hazy yellow color some haze but not gravy looking a finger and a half of soapy foamy white head this looks really nice  nose is not very strong what i get is citrus notes tangerine mainly very mild tropical notes but what really takes the lead is the piney weed like scents not strong but stronger than everything else  taste is a lot of that pine and weed dankness the initial impact is solid but not overwhelming that resinous quality persists throughout but it is kept under control the citrus sits underneath a mild undertone the flavors are balanced and delicate there is nothing aggressive about this brew mild to medium bitterness almost no hop burn no flavor overstaying its welcome this is such a smooth and casual drinker  mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild to medium carbonation wow this mouthfeel suits this brew perfectly its justhow can i say it light comfortable drinkable smooth it just fits it practically drinks it self i finished this a little more quickly than i thought i would the drinkability on this one is crazy  overall i meanthis is not a jooze bomb or an overthetop hazy but this takes strides in showing how important balance is in a brew using just mosaic toppling goliath has crafted a wonderful casual drinker if i could find this more readily available in my area this would be staple material it would sit on my shelf next to green and 90 minute anytime of the year,0.5785743475354472,0.9791
4752,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,funky buddha brewery maple bacon coffee porter 22 fl oz brown glass bottle bottled on 122817 and sampled on 122618  notes via stream of consciousness first off this is labeled as 2018 and yet they packaged it in 2017 so they actually sat on it for a year to age it interesting its poured a typical porterstout appearance with a black body beneath a creamy head of khaki colored foam the aroma is fantastic it smells like a coffee liquor it melds sweet maple syrup with black coffee and chocolate syrup and for whatever reason thats taken me for a moment back to my days in the boy scouts its clean and bright and enticing although i havent really found the bacon yet just a suggestion of it ok on to the flavor more coffee basic but good just like a regular cup of joe black coffee more maple syrup as expected and kind of sweet chocolate syrup some vanilla but im still not finding the bacon i wasnt really expecting bacon but maybe some apple smoked wood maltiness or am i missing it i get coffee maple toffee almost burnt but not sugar vanilla medium to darker caramel some background fruitiness and a bit of ashen roastiness is it smoky i dont think so not really there is some in the far away background but i wouldnt consider it smoky still its good its nice and rich without being overly so and sweetish but not too sweet although some of that maple sugar does linger on the palate its not really a dessert beer though or is it it could certainly be used as an ingredient in a dessert but it is rich enough to be a dessert beer on its own ahhh maybe so ok what else medium bodied and gently crisp then smooth  review 6436,0.5785268170523851,0.9923
5522,Juicy,2016 vintage bottle at the brewery a pours a mostly clear copper color with a quickly receding fizzy white head s suggestions of pepper and funk with an understated tartness there is a sharpness in the nose that suggests cheese though not as much as in other beers of this ilk t pulled back a touch definite funk and tartness but surprising mild with a clean biscuity malt profile followed by some hints of lemon and apple definite hints of pepper as well this beer sits comfortably somewhere in between a classically defined saison and a farmhouse ale neither malt heavy nor funksour heavy as it settles out some of the tartness dies down m definitely dry but with a fullness that lingers on the tongue o excellent but not revelatory definitely lives up to its name in the juicy department not my favorite kind of farmhouse ale but great for what it is balanced and immediate in presentation allowing for the nuances to drift gradually out from under the more prominent and defining notes,0.5785141868094018,0.9835
2328,Breakfast Stout,previously consumed and often this review will be perfunctory its undeniably one of the best in the world out from the 12 ounce bottle into a clear imperial pint glass its a richly deep and dark brown with a modest tan head the roasted malt chocolate and oat aroma cant be surpassed by any in this style it just might be the smoothest and richest brew you can find the taste overall is complexly bittersweet theres so much good going on but the prominent flavors are roasted not burnt nor overly roasted barley malt then coffee then chocolate if thats not enough for the taste buds to discern theres some sort of mild spiciness created by the infusion of the major contributors an amazing mouthfeel for such an abv this may be the worlds best stout,0.5784906936486227,0.9806
5202,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,poured into a teku glass from a 12oz can  canned on 112119  drank on 050320  this beer poured absolutely pitch black and had a dark brown head which had some nice rocky bubbles to it the head was about a finger thick and had moderate retention  nosing my glass strong notes of bourbon hit my nose first this was then followed by notes of black licorice caramel dark chocolate and coffee there was a tiny bit of vanilla in the backend i wasnt the biggest fan of the black licorice aroma on this but the depth and complexity on this made up for it  the taste followed the nose with notes of bourbon caramel coffee and dark chocolate upfront which faded in the middle to just notes of bourbon there was a notable earthy taste to this beer throughout and the beer finished with lingering notes of bourbon and earthiness  this beer was big full bodied boozy and it didnt try to hide it you definitely have to sip on this one and with a large coffeebitter burnt and earthy aftertaste i definitely wasnt in a hurry to down this beer  i can definitely see this being really good for some people with a tasty for bourbon forward roasty and earthy stouts but this one wasnt really for me,0.5784825567989372,0.96
2979,Gggreennn!,canned 111120 how gggreen are you stamped on the bottom  coming to this one fresh off the heels of the base beer green which i wasnt all that impressed with this one isnt quite as acclaimed but still sits at 131 of all time on this site also ironic that a beer named gggreennn is beer 420 for me  pours a hazy radiant goldish orange with 2 fingers of white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing  despite being about a week older than the can of green i had this smells even more fresh than that did the aroma seems more tropical here lots of cantaloupe mango pineapple papaya and tangerine backed with oily hops and biscuity malt  the taste starts off with loads of citrus orange and pineapple with some tart lime in the background as well as oily hops the swallow brings notes of grapefruit rind pale malt tangerine and resinous hops a bit more balanced than the base beer despite the extra hopping  just like the base beer in feel medium in body except with just a bit more carbonation for a zippy feel finishes mostly dry and bitter  definitely better than green itself funny i didnt see the same thing with julius vs jjjuliusss where the base beer was miles better regardless both good beers im sad to have made it through all the reviews for my case from tree house but i suppose i should get back to reviewing other styles ,0.5784644529093586,0.9809
5103,Barrel Aged Bomb!,bottle pours thick from the bottle like many bomb beers ive had it looks almost too thick to generate much head which it doesnt a thin brown veil of bubbles fizzes away quickly a thin rim does resuscitate and fade easily  molasses early chocolate espresso beans with a hint of whiskey later at times theres also a little cherrywood like tang  taste also has a little tang to it the main flavors in this version lean a lot more towards chocolate than others maybe its the notes from the barrel aging that bring it out a little more there is actually a candy bar aspect to this with marshmallow and light undertones of toffee  chewy full bodied feel a little alcohol burn more than chile pepper bite  comes across as a nice after dinner drink it could easily replace a coffee or light liqueur mixed beverage after dinner,0.5783864911997694,0.7976

5682,Hop JuJu,can dated 21821 glbc tulip  a pours a bright crystalclear orangeygold one finger white head dissolves quickly to a 116 skim of foam that lasts tiny stream of carbonation coming from the center looks how i want and expect a dipa to look except not much lacing to speak of  s immediately when i cracked the can open i smelled the hops from a foot and a half away smells sweet tropical piney and floral more tropical aromas than i expected actually pineapple mango hyacinth  t initial burst of lightly sweet tangy hoppiness crisp crackery malt center on mid palate with the hops beginning to express themselves turning at the end to a big brash bold explosion of dank floral high note hops the slightest hint of alcohol is detectable on the finish blended in with that bold lingering floral hop bite  m this beer really stands out in terms of feel it is supremely crisp for something so big never cloying and for as bruising as it should be for this abv and ibu it is remarkably drinkable dont get me wrong its a bruiser of a beer but it feels remarkably light on the palate for the style not astringent at all pretty low carb not much of the fluff i enjoy from ales hard at this gravity  o ive said it before and ill say it again i am too old to be drinking beers like this it is a big potent relatively clean hop wallop if that is what you are in the mood for tropical and floral not oniony or garlicky or too piney on the palate which is good for me although there is a good crisp clean malt presence this beer is totally out of balance in favor of hops although the alcohol is well hidden it is noticeable on the finish and this will impair you on the first beer esp in a 16 ounce can perfectly to style  i came i saw i conquered more than anything the craftsmanship of this beer makes me want to revisit the other fat heads beers i havent had in a while and to try some of those i havent had before,0.5783461205524473,0.9923

591,Double Sunshine,had this during the new england trip october 2019 was a little leery the sip of sunshine i had years before was vastly overrated but every other beer i had from lawsons had been awesome  pours a yellow color with a minority amount of light orange to it 13 white head i dig the ctzcitra combo for the aroma orange infused weed leans more on the citra but ctz is so damn tough it can stand out even when used sparingly compared to other hops  taste is real nice that ctz bitterness but with a green vibe beyond the normal pine bittering hop combined with citra bringing that orange and tangerine fruitiness to the taste profile mouth feel helped along by a small amount of flaked oats that doesnt cause a haze trub bomb on the appearance scale good use of carapils and corn sugarsyrup as well for a drier body you really get the best of both ipa worlds with this beer hides the alcohol so well you can crush these like a session ipa if you dont regulate yourself top notch,0.578171797974681,0.8596
5927,Peche 'n Brett,poured into a teku glass from a 375ml bottle  this beer poured out a pastel orange color onto my glass also hazy in appearance from the yeast it had about a finger thick white colored head on my initial pour but it disappeared almost immediately leaving a bit of a lacing around my glass  the aroma on this was both funky and peachy upfront being true to its name peche n brett while i mostly got stone fruit aromas ranging from notes of peaches to apricots i was also able to perceive notes of caramel and vanilla in the backend with the funk and oakiness still present  upfront on the taste i was able to get a nice presence of sweet peaches with a slight nectarine sourness as well the sour nectarine notes lingered to the middle and finish and was accompanied by notes of underripe mandarin oranges overall i would say that the sour nectarinelike taste was the most prominent flavor that i got  this was medium bodied and had a moderate amount of carbonation to it as for its drinkability i thought that this was super easy to drink despite having a 10 abv almost no alcohol was perceived  i thought that this beer overall was pretty decent but not my personal favorite it was very good and highly drinkable but it seemed a little boring for me to drink i wish it was a bit more fruity than sour but it isnt bad at all how it was when i drank it,0.5781711364049317,0.9877

4408,Hopslam Ale,although previously consumed a review hasnt yet been posted so this time a twelve ounce brown bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass it looks good but not inspiring the color is a bright and light copperamber on the translucent side theres only a slight head and no glass lacing the aroma begins to improve expectations as theres malt hops and even honey to detect the taste starts with a good full on earthy malt character this never gets bitter but it never gets too sweet the body is near perfect and the balance of malt to hop is unassailable that must be quite the accomplishment since honey is in the mix a wonderful exchange of sweeter malt and mild hops that 0deliveres a tasteful brew that may disguise its high abv better than any other outstanding,0.578016869911572,0.9822
6206,Second Fiddle,canned 21821  its funny i had heard of this beer a few times here and there over the years but it doesnt seem to be too widely discussed when i picked it up at the store i figured i was just go for it little did i know that it currently sits at 240 of all time here of ba which naturally drives my expectations up lets see if it can live up to this  pours a cloudy golden orange with 3 fingers of dense white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  in the nose theres less of a malt presence than my favorite iipas but it is still nicely balanced more so balanced in terms of different hops expressions im picking up on aromas of pine sap pithy grapefruit mango orange zest white pepper lemon a touch of honey and light bready malt  this bitters up even more in taste but keeps it interesting while remaining classic at the same time on the front of the sip im tasting pine sap resiny hops orange zest and a touch of pale malt the swallow brings notes of oily pine white pepper pale malt and a touch pf lemon  a medium body pairs with gentle carbonation resulting in a crisp and refreshing beer finishes completely dry and bitter  while this was quite good i dont think its as good as many make it out to be that being said id get it again in a heartbeat,0.5779978746435905,0.9661

1130,V.S.O.J.,commonly regarded as the best barrelaged english barleywine in the us hopes are extremely high aroma is a tad overwhelmed by the high abv as im finding it difficult to find complex characteristics through the alcohol burn pull the glass away a bit and you can pick up aromas of sweet caramel malts coconut and vanilla truffles  after the first sip i understand the reputation its so incredibly balanced with flavors dominated by oakderived coconut old leather booze soaked raisins and creme brûlée this base beer was brewed for barrelaging it spent years expanding and contracting into the american oak staves wading through the spirits that previously resided there it lets the barrel shine but maintains its own identity finishes with mouthnumbing alcohol but the slick coconut flavors last for minutes after its absolutely epic and outside of 2016 whiskey a deal with the devil its the best barleywine ive ever had unreal,0.5770688998576917,0.5499

5730,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),this is from a 2015 edition of the 12year elijah craig  ink black body relatively thin yet dense and creamy light tan head light aroma of whiskey faint traces of cocoa and roasted malt rich malty flavor dense with milk chocolate oak and bourbon vanilla heavy body dense and oily chewy and sweet tempered with a nice whiskey warmth  i believe the aroma may have suffered some with five years of age but the taste and mouthfeel really shine on this beer the boozy character adds a nice balancing quality to the thick rich sweetness of this imperial stout im sure the honey greatly adds to the feel and taste i must admit that this has been around for a few years but at nearly 3500 a pop i wasnt too keen on taking a stab at this in this case i probably should have sucked it up and gone for it chances are ill be checking out some of their other versions plus there are some newer versions of the eclipse stouts that are now calling my name oh the humanity,0.5752426094946466,0.8193

4249,Saison Bernice,pours a clouded golden yellow with a medium sized sized spongy head  smells of leathery basement mushrooms sweet candy and a touch of vinegar offers a rustic crushed grain quality with a note of white bread dough has a flowery note atop making this pleasantly complex  a bright sparkly effervescence defines the beers mouthfeel finishing with a long lasting bitterness  has a dustiness to it which numbs the taste from start till the end with a distractingly acetic sourness partially covered by dried mushrooms and old leather hints of oak and old cork are cutting through establishing a well working unique balance tied together by white bread dough and a slightly spicen yeast foundation has a dried leaves dryness during the finish with an ongoing funkiness providing an intriguing depth  reminding me more of a sour than of a traditional saison that being said this is very interesting to me based on its strong headed rustic character which is actually hard to compare to anything else i assume its their house character which is very appealing since it offers a never before experienced melange of dried nuts mushrooms vinegar and lots of basement oak i like it i think,0.574758731975541,0.8135
1784,Fourth Dementia - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,rating 2011 bottle aged 6 years very nice old ale moderately sweet nice silky mouthfeel just a touch if heat had a slightly black licorice taste to it which was slightly off putting to me which kept me from rating it higher nice beer overall though glad to finally try this,0.5747029715109313,0.9286

5318,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,description appearance is glassy and black with a small amount of dark tan foam smell is deep and rich with cinnamon and chilies dominating chocolate vanilla and bourbon are also evident providing for a complex aroma the taste carries the same cinnamon and chilies but they are extremely prevalent to the point that the bourbon chocolate and other underlying flavors are drowned out its a hot spicy and slightly bitter finish that doesnt keep up with the richness of the smell feel is a little thin for a stout with low carbonation as can be expected  overall 375 this beer is good but i would not likely drink it again manhad high hopes for this but honestly just didnt enjoy it that much the aroma was great but the taste put me off it was too spicyhot for me and the bourbon seemed to get completely lost given the ba rating and how outstanding jackie os is with stouts i apparently set my expectations too high,0.5746352996790949,0.9282

4510,BDCS,l black as pitch brew no light passes even at the fringes of my firestone teku a finger and a half of dense camel hued head with average retention but a unique fingerprint of wide and thin splotchy lacing  s soy sauce but lighter so than all soy brews ive encountered this aroma is offset by burnt sugars sweet molasses dark roasted malts and the slightest vanilla and tobacco for a complex and mouthwatering brew more vanilla as it warms  t follows the aroma mostly but tends sweeter than id hoped for the sugars mask the complexity found on the nose still quite good impossible that a beer rates so high on all parameters but only good on taste  f highest mouthfeel rating ive given to a beer lacking the weight and sticky viscosity of the best bcbs years this one is thinner but also an amazing balance of syrup sticky oily and creamy it is lighter weight perfection you must experience  o i didnt set out for a verbose review but while so many ba stouts fall short of my local fremonts this one came outta nowhere with its complexity and simultaneous subtlety a stellar brew on the nose especially which deserves to be tried by stoutlovers the world over,0.5745590101057404,0.9896
4233,Saison Bernice,bottled may 2020 poured relatively conservatively into a standard pint glass attractive hazy yellow color with a medium amount of fluffy white head a thin layer of which lingers for some time tons of lacing which is unusual at least for the saisons  farmhouse ales i typically drink definitely picking up the sour on the nose although its not overwhelming taste is pleasantly tart and just the tiniest bit of funk in the aftertaste feel is pillowy soft and smooth less carbonation than i expected based on the effervescence that was present upon opening the bottle this is a very well done saison,0.5745451146715509,0.8777

4109,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,this beers pours hazy orange with moderate white head not super thick hazy like some ne styles but you cant see thru it big smells of that vegetal onion mosaic pineapple that is typical from that hop the flavor follows the nose all mosaic kind of disappointing because the dry hopping over powered the entire beer it is a mosaic bomb unfortunately and i do not love that hop love the galaxy version of this,0.5744266526905225,-0.9045
3052,Cable Car Kriek,shared by ygtbsm94 at the sour  wild ale tasting on april 14 2012 thanks a lot brad  served side by side with an unlabeled bottle of cable car kriek apparently more tart than the labeled  distributed version  served in my lost abbey teku glass  after the beer gushed everywhere it appears a beautiful ruby hue with a soft pink head bonus points for the pretty appearance deductions for the carbonation issues so commonly associated with the lost abbey  beautiful aroma tart cherries and distinctive lost abbey funk  not especially tart but a delicate balance of sweet cherry and tart funky wild ale again very well done  light on the palate moderate carbonation on the tongue  overall this was quite good aside from the gushing i have no complaints im grateful for the opportunity to try this rare delicacy not to mention two versions side by side,0.5744059699037544,0.9828
4355,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,poured a turbid murky orange color  is very reminiscent of oj nose smells of ojcitrus with a honey sweetness and a mild bitterness on the end taste follows the nose sweet citrus followed by some bitterness but ends with hop burnresin that remains for a bit  the can was rolled before opening feel is viscous and think for an iipa but has very good carb overall this smells incredible and initial good taste but the hop burn overtakes the palate maybe the hops need to dye down some  but this can is around a month old at this point have two other cans and will open in increments over the next month will update if the taste increase,0.5743635717963151,0.9167
4052,Double Nelson,12 oz can canned 042219 four days old moderate pour yields a 15 inch white head over a hazy light golden straw colored body with nice sticky lacing nose of orange orange pith orange zest and slight white grape taste mirrors nose beautifully with an orange pith bitterness near the finish and then dry white wine at the finish very nice feel and overall after having this on tap a couple times it was nice to get a can and enjoy and review at home cheers to shaun and crew for yet another delight,0.5743529786579831,0.9633
2374,Miami Madness,042016  jwbs sours are a bit too acidic and borderline harsh for me  i think its the guava  and this was no exception but i do appreciate all the fruit namely the passionfruit and mango that pops abound,0.5743331087246674,0.25
1898,Chocolate Rain,i like this variant maybe better than the base beer  thin with the mouthfeel warming semidry when you consider the style barrel aging and adds  the high abv is apparent but not overwhelming not over barreled oak vanilla lower levels of dark chocolate  the nose is all about the vanilla and the barrel quite pleasant and as noted not over done,0.574326250181154,0.7261
476,Very Green,day 2 of being able to snag some tree house whales canned 92121 a mere 4 days old  pours out dark yellow with some translucency a finger of tight compact bubbles form another picture perfect pour  nose is tropical fruit and a strong presence of pine and dankness some pineapple and mango comes through but its mostly that dank weediness  taste is very green indeed huge pine bitterness swells to a high point the dankness is strong here on the palate as well this is certainly a stronger version of their green its got that peppery quality to it the same way green does the bitterness doesnt linger too heavily overall it peaks high for a neipa but not nearly as long as a west coast it gives a taste and then eventually resets to neutral more quickly  mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with mild carbonation this one isnt as pillowy and soft as others there is a little thinness to this brew maybe a little watery  overall another fantastic tree house dipa while this brew is great its not quite as excellent as king julius the jump from julius to the king is much more of a leap from green to very green still wonderful though and a phenomenal brew to have with sharp cheddar they compliment each other perfectly,0.5743001341630132,0.9899
2812,The Peach,had this alongside the imperial apricot bu this one wasnt nearly as tart when but it got considerably more tart as it warmed tons of peach on the nose and palate here though and i thoroughly enjoyed it total peach bomb,0.5742865956217269,0.4257
994,Chemtrailmix,this glass of used motor oil on draft has brown staining legs in spades and a lesser mocha fizz than its unspiced unaged younger brothers  a shit ton of spicy cinnamon melds with wet brown sugar while raisin black pepper and woody rye boldly accent that peppercorn actually comes out more this time contrasting all the powdery cinnamon smoky charred oak and sweet dark chocolate covered raspberry that this mother isnt shy to throw at you  a bit of a sting runs through the smoothly slick thickly round body that swallows semidry and heats the tummy  is this even better than last years sleeper hit i think so the more pronounced character of peppercorn really enhances the rye presence and adds infinite complexity and depth to a beer that sounds like it might be over the top this is a hell of an experience    at dld 2019 i had the new version which is the same treatment as the stellar 2018 version but found it to have a shockingly big explosion of not entirely spicy but dusty cinnamon on the exhale i still got the total cinnamon toast crunch and brown sugar deliciousness of the past year but the front end is a little more potent and spicy than past years its still one of the better variants amongst a collection of great brews but not my favorite this year,0.574242762000452,0.9011
2587,The Rusty Nail,this one was quite disappointing for me i had expected a lot based on the extremely high ratings here on ba and i love oatmeal stouts but this one just didnt quite deliver 2019 edition printed on bottle pours a thicker black color with just a little tan head and very small amounts of lingering lacing smells of some medium roast coffee dark chocolate caramel brown sugar vanilla cinnamon spices a hint of bourbon taste follows the nose but i was expecting more depth and balance and this just didnt quite do it for me dont get me wrong it was solid just not mind blowing smooth slightly sticky mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation i wished it were creamier and more licious a good beer but i likely wont try it again,0.5742406434921355,0.8699
5516,Juicy,appearance with a nice hearty vigorous pour the beer produced about a 25 finger of soft white foamy head about half of the foam laced the glass after about a minute or two of sitting  aroma it smells of wine barrel oak tart cherry and other fruity aromas  taste on the first sip i pick up some tart funk some straw some wine barrel at the very end of the sip there is a really subtle slight bitter finish it is really refreshing and enjoyable  mouthfeel it seems to carry a lower carb feel to it but it works for me  overall this lived up to the hype for me it was a really good enjoyable beer for me i like what the wine barrels did to the overall taste of the beer thanks to jhavs for making this one happen,0.5742312215364338,0.9528
5276,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),review is based on the dregs last in line for a pour pours a cloudy orange hue akin to sunny delight nose expresses citrus rind a just a hint of the wine barrel taste follows nose  a little little yeasty but to be expected considering the pour was off the bottom of the bottle mouthfeel is light in body with a mild even carbonation all and all quite enjoyable however id like to revisit with a proper pour,0.5741584306721466,0.8977

4837,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,pour produced a common frothy top that befits many a cloudy beer the coloring fits on the paler yellow end lacking ay orange hue that some hazies bring to the table the aforementioned head had some stickiness to it and provided a fair amount of lacing  i am not getting a burst of aromas from the nose but the aromas i am getting is pretty standard for the style starting out i perceive a bit of the malt and alternatives and a somewhat muddled citrus note i then get a little sweet melon thread through grapefruit and tangerine the aromas are whispering that this beer might actually have some bitterness and i think i am getting a familiar yeast note as well  though i couldnt say why  ok the opening starts like i expected with the malts laying down a dry grayhay base citra fruit pith come next but there is also a sugary sweetness peeking out from the corner its mildly distracting but doesnt drive out the notes that i am enjoying in fact the sweetness fades and melds into the rawbitter citrus rind notes to bring out a bit of tropical fruit flesh what i take as oatwheat in the hazy ne ipas i get next it seems to help carry the citrus rind through  especially the pith and the bitterness that brings is the last thing im left with as the beer enters my gullet  a very good ipa that brings some fruitiness but stays grounded with some back end bitterness,0.5736599912353031,0.9722
2087,Flora Plum,juicy ripe plums picked and appropriately timed to perfection in this beer incredible nectar and plenty of gleekysourness to it without the harsh finish very smooth on the way down this is hands down one of the very best fruited saisons ive ever had the pleasure to try the pour is a hazy yellow trillium ipa with minimal lacing around the edge of the glass aroma is intense with fruit something unique about the funk its not overwhelming but reminds me for some reason of a russian river sour the way the sweetness lingers through the finish and the smooth mouthfeel ends with no puckering this thing is awesome,0.573596216797611,0.9473
875,Parabola,poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip this is the 2021 version aged in bourbon rye and wheated whiskey barrels its hard to imagine ive gotten this far in my beerdrinking life and have never yet tasted any parabola  appearance entirely black with a finger and a half of thick creamy darktan foam atop beers like this really have a headstart on looking good dont they  smell wood malt whiskey maybe a little chocolate thrown in for good measure therere notes of dark fruit as well which you know i always love  taste rich thats for damn sure theres dark cherry and raisin and date and prune of course but also just a bit of oak and whiskey that add an extra dimension to the fruit and sweetness and booze very very good indeed really very wonderful  mouthfeel thick body with a good carbonation and plenty of smooth rich creaminess  overall you never know what youre walking into when it comes to a beer that has a big reputation whether its an oldie or something super hyped this beer is just downright excellent,0.5735271320355938,0.9931
3674,Everett Porter,a pours pitch black with a mocha colored head head is quite creamy looking with decent retention average lacing good looking but nothing special  s well this smells like a very traditional but intense porter there are chocolate malts coffee notes but not espresso leather pecans vanilla and some very light cherries this a dark round and complex smelling porter  t if the smell made me think of coffee without being espresso the taste really puts the espresso right in the front and center there is cacao powder vanilla leather cherries much stronger than in the smell oak like tannins pecans and a little bit of earth the balance is wonderful and with very little residual sweetness  m ive never had a hill farmstead beer that hadnt a perfect mouthfeel for the genre this is the case here too its broad and round heavy but not too much with a low and soft carbonation  o this truly is a wonderful beer from an incredible brewery that doesnt seem to know how to brew a bad beer the only thing i can say about this beer and i think its the first time i say it is that it would benefit to have a little bit more sweetness not a lot just a little bit also with its predominant espresso notes this beer really sits in between a stout and a porter,0.5734869900288836,0.9809
6108,Caffè Americano,on tap well theres a big espresso component to this beer and the vanilla plays accent to the bold coffee notes it also stays away from being too sweet though its not dry either  black body and a brown head that turns lighter as it fades slowly thin ring doesnt lace the glass on the heavy side for feel which makes for a bold beer overall  nose is creamed coffee and a hint of chocolate cake batter taste brings the espresso and vanilla as stated which merge to a moist chocolate brownie flavor before the end a bit of alcohol squeaks through an espresso  roasted stout bitterness that gets through in the end  one of those beers that does a good job with the additions while keeping a fingertip at least on the base style,0.5734718125039071,0.9042
6076,Blanc De Blancs,poured from a 375 into an sp durobar glass color was vibrant yelloworange with not much haze once dregs were poured aroma was unripened green grape peel and chardonnay taste followed with the addition of oak really well balanced too cant believe this is 10 phenomenal brew would love another,0.5734689106051033,0.8748

3486,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,bottle from 2015 consumed april 2021  bomber into a tulip served at about 63 small tan head that quickly dissipated dark as cola some amber when held to the light  fudge and bourbon on the nose vanilla too prepastry pastry just lovely drawing you in  very bourbon forward on the palate not much roast still super hot cant imagine this fresh smooth coffee on the back end full bodied to style but not nearly as thick as modern counterparts  very satisfying great beer worthy of the old money hype,0.5731965885140534,0.9683
2309,Abricot Du Fermier,poured from a 750ml bottle into an oversized snifter pours a hazy and bubbly orange with fluffy bright white head which eventually dissipates leaving a nice foam collar around the glass some offwhite swirls remain throughout the pour smells of fresh sliced apricot oak wine and a hint of vanilla its all there and combines for an amazing aroma but the fruit is the star here the barrels give it more complexity than it would have otherwise but its very fruit forward taste is basically dominated by fruit however the barrel characteristics are more noticeable than on the nose its sour but its also refreshing borders on light and heavy as it starts off lighter simple and more refreshing but gets heavier and more complex as it lingers on the tongue and finishes feel is smooth and full with an oaky dryness on the finish overall this is my favorite fruited fermier as i feel like apricot works so well with sour beer the combination of the base beer along with red wine barrels and apricots is exquisite this one probably doesnt show the balance that some of the other fruited fermiers have pêche and kriek come to mind but i dont mind that at all as this allows the apricots to shine with just enough backup from the extendedaged base sdf,0.5731519592260956,0.9498
1703,Green,canned 112020 green for you green for me stamped on the bottom  of the new to me beers in the mixed case i got from tree house last week this is the highest rated on here currently sitting at 56 all time lets see if it lives up to the hype  pours a hazy pale orange with 3 fingers of dense soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing  green is probably the best descriptor for the aroma here the hops are lush grassy and oily but counterbalanced by soft malt pepper and tropical fruit aromas of cantaloupe pineapple and blood orange  the hops on the front end of the taste are so bright and citrusy huge notes of tangerine fresh cut pine orange and pineapple on the swallow this sadly does not find the balance i was expecting the grassy hops are dialed up along with notes of grapefruit and pale malt not mind blowing but still a solid flavor  a medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation which works well with the hop intensity creating a fresh and crisp drinking experience finishes mostly dry and a touch bitter  its funny this is one of the highest rated brews in the world but i just wasnt that impressed is it well executed yeah of course i just think it could do more in the way of balance,0.5731427780766376,0.9731
4934,Affogato,coffee black albeit opaque with a short but dense creamy mocha head that retains as a thin but fluffy blanket until dying to just a curled ring  the super round lusciously fluffy mediumfull body delivers creamy fresh vanilla whip swirled into the smooth presence of medium roast coffee exhibiting big punches of dark chocolate morsels all gliding along a tingly carbonation that recedes into a just semidry finish the longer i dig in the chocolatier and fluffier it gets developing further hints of mocha liqueur and crystalized toffee or even peanut brittle while also becoming a little sticky on the lips  theres a little bit of a charred brown sugar element you might experience in mexican coffee and as the lactose builds on the palate it becomes tough to drink even splitting the bottle with my old lady  i just couldnt wait to duo dome this bottle with her as fresh as possible after this b2 release and it was not a disappointment theres no question why this beer set off trilliums pastry stout odyssey as this b2 is no slouch and still the best pastry stout theyve put out with biscotti  coffee and ba affogato being my other tops,0.5731189820605482,0.9745
720,KBS,pours opaque black with a dark brown head not as much lacing as you might expect  chocolate and booze on the nose malt and coffee in the background that barrel aged smell is prevalent but really pretty well balanced it just smells delicious  huge flavor its big and boozy but also a nice bitter malty backbone there is a hint of sweetness but i certainly wouldnt call this beer sweet i dont get much of the coffee flavor personally id say the chocolate flavor is the stronger one but bittersweet chocolate the barrel flavor is there in the start and the finish but not overwhelming it just gives the whole thing a nice edge and a long warming finish  its full bodied and just a tiny bit viscous but not at all syrupy just right for washing around your mouth for maximum flavor  there are other exciting barrelaged stouts out there but for balance and just perfect execution this has to be one of the absolute best,0.5730837624558672,0.9948
2563,Beyond Good And Evil,shared with a friend while in europe bottle dated 2017 which i purchased in january 2018  pours an inky thick opaque back with coffeeandcream head that dissipates relatively quickly some faint light lacing on glass  aroma is earthy malt and dark bread hint of molasses something very vaguely like tequila which is probably woody character from the barrel aging but a little spicier than most bourbon barrel stouts ive sampled  flavour is complex incredibly smooth and balanced  hit of dark malty goodness up front slightly bitter but immediately followed by a sweet undercurrent of maple and spice which finishes with a hint of licorice a big difference with this versus other big barrelaged beers ive enjoyed is that even the barrel character seems balanced  this is a pretty solidly crafted brew no element is over the top  im honestly pretty amazed that there is still a slight residual maple flavour here often the taste of the syrup is lost when the yeast ferment it away  no indication of its strength on the label but going on taste alone id say its well north of 89 my guess is 10 abv the price of the bottle was a bit steep for 375 ml but this stout was years in the making and im glad to have shared it with a friend,0.5730533607344396,0.992

3547,Fundamental Forces,500ml bottle poured into a snifter  black small light brown head which quickly fully diminishes  the nose has strong barrel vanilla and bourbon which play well together with a touch of anise  the flavor is dominated by bourbon to the point of being unbalanced vanilla and anise kick in as secondary flavors  the feel is thinner then your typical bottle logic static beer but it is still medium body there is a good amount of heat  no surprise at 18  it has a creamy feel to it  even with its bourbon dominance i still really like the beer i think it does all come together in a nice way provided you like the bourbon flavor,0.5721864512400803,0.9576
4260,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),muddy dark brown with a tan very tall airy foam head that slowly condenses to a thick sponge before settling to a very pleasantly sturdy soft blanket  toasted wheat and clove present up front and even a bit of peppery spice comes out on the swallow touches of plum and date then accent the mediumlight body as its substantial froth collapses on the palate into a slick and easy semidry swallow pricked up by a bit of heat an additional development of baked apple with hints of cinnamon and licorice crops up as it warms  this is definitely the most phenolic of the westys which makes sense for the style for which this is a standard setter,0.572159668334499,0.8439

3627,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,having had all armand4 last week plus various other 3f goodies i was curious how i would feel about a 2010 lpg this week  looked beautiful clear and gold poured with moderate carb and a bit of head smelled like tart cantillon rather sweet and a bit fruity taste followed suit delicious tartness a bit more tart than apple cider perhaps some wine barrel i didnt find it as bitter as the classic bio gueuze fairly sweet and the mouthfeel was incredible  had nice body and quite sufficient balancing tannins butvery little depth or funk found the drinkability high but the complexity lacking perhaps as others have stated it needed more time i plan to never open a lpg this young again i believe it was the 2013 bottling of the 2010 vintage opened july 2016,0.571987901145722,0.879
2501,Bourbon Paradise,look this pours black with almost no carbonation a thin tan bit if head dissipates quickly  smell smells boozy with some chocolate no much else  taste i get the strong booze backing a bitter dark chocolate followed by slight vanilla wheres the coconut  feel like a standard prairie good viscosity the coats the tongue but the booze overpowering the adjuncts gives it a quick finish that doesnt linger  compared to most prairie dawgs this one lands at about a 4 because of the imbalance of boozeadjuncts and the lacking sweetness i love 90 dark chocolate so have no problem with bitter it just doesnt go well here,0.5719810836891328,0.8962

4606,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,season 1718 blend 57 bottled 52218  time to crack open my first 3 fonteinen this is currently the 7th highest rated gueuze and the 185th highest rated beer overall im making slow but steady progress on trying the top 250 anyhow im excited for this one and im in the mood for something funky so this is perfect picked this up at julians in providence yesterday while i was getting takeout on lunch break lets pop it open  pours a cloudy orange gold with just a finger of white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing  oh yeah thats super funky in the nose a bunch of earthy notes all coming together im picking up on aromas of white pepper wet hay white wine vinegar apple skin old leather sharp oak lemon rind and straw  surprisingly theres not too much depth to the flavor on this one the nose was quite misleading on the front end of the sip im tasting lemon rind sharp oak light vinegar and straw the swallow picks up a bit thankfully bringing notes of apple skin wet hay pear white pepper old leather and minerally white wine  a medium body pairs with fine tingling carbonation resulting in a sharp tart beer finishes mostly dry with an intense funk  i liked this well enough but nothing that actively amazed me maybe it came down to how the beer was stored so i cant knock it too hard,0.5719576041730919,0.9795
1250,Anabasis,semiclear mahogany to prune juice dark brown with faint purple hues and a short fuzzy tan head that quickly dies to a used motor oil looking surface there might be some tiny chunks of barrel char towards the bottom of the pour but they are minimal  viscous almost syrupy yet silky smooth anabasis b3 kicks off with dark fruit and reisen before a sudden surprisingly woody barrel presence its a little splintery at first and quite mature before developing some notes of decadence with time such as nutty nougat maple and hints of caramel apple  quite delicious but maybe a little too woody so i have a few other preferred favorites in this category frankly im still surprised by the lofty pedestals that barleywines like this are placed while breweries like cigar city just casually put out bangers on the regular that are at least just as good    sharing a b5 bottle with friends midmay 2021 im finding it to be surprisingly chocolatey while theres a ton of bourbon barrel on back end its simultaneously less woody overall allowing room for the darker malts to really edge this ever closer to stout territory the charred oak adds classic nougat impressions but also some unexpected marzipan qualities  its overall less astringent and hoppy than i remember b3 and as such im enjoying it even more even if it is drifting further away from american or even english life as such im hesitant to alter my already fairly high score,0.571944344436599,0.9936
5148,Clare's Thirsty Ale,2016 on draft december 2016  look  medium thickness with minimal head  smell  straight raspberries and chocolate very little barrel taste  heavy raspberries very sweet however the chocolate mixes in nicely too minimal barrel  feel  below average thickness  overall  an overall excellent beer however the baby backyard ratings seem a bit off to me because there is almost no barrel presence and the berry flavor are overly potent that said its still an excellent beer but im not willing to crown it at this point,0.5718838971172928,0.7778

2738,Blåbær Lambik,l deep dark purple hue with a nice amount of carb retention after the pour gorgeous s tons of that lovely cantillon funk with a complimenting undertone of fruit that smooths out the nose t similar to smell perfect funkiness and just the slightest hint of juicy blueberry the most authentic blueberry flavor ive ever experienced in a beer f great carb level does just enough to cut through the juicy funk so that the taste both coats and lingers for further enjoyment overall this lived beyond what i had expected blueberry is such a difficult flavor to impart into beer and cantillon once again blew me away im stingy with chasing down hyped beers but this is one i would recommend again and again,0.5717383845020948,0.9128
5142,Clare's Thirsty Ale,been looking forward to trying this one for a long time and am stoked to have finally gotten the chance this is a really neat and sort of unexpected beer strange to name a strong barrel aged stout thirsty ale like it implies easy drinking or high volume beer or something but this is anything but and it would take a special kind of thirst to want to drink a ton of this one a rye whiskey barrel aged imperial stout with raspberries and a wonderful one at that i go back and forth on the fruited stouts sometimes they get way too sweet and candylike with the chocolate in the malt and the fruit sugars but the raspberries are as tart as they are sweet in this so while it has some residual sugar and raspberry jam qualities its also really natural tasting clean and fairly acidic from their tartness its amazing how forward the fruit is in such a dense strong dark beer sure there is still plenty of dark malt in here its intensely roasty with a coffee quality to it and there is some barrel char and earthy wet wood as well but the summery brightness of the berries lightens it all up and really defines this beer for me rye is a smart choice for barrels too its less sweet in this manifestation than bourbon would have been and the dense slightly spicy rye character makes the grain base seem particularly interesting to me light vanilla too but it isnt desserty so much dark cocoa a little bitterness and whiskey along with old school raspberry jam in the finish its just delicious and about as well done as something like this could be this reminds me of an excellent raspberry stout i had from hardywood park a few years back but with the barrel but other than that beer quite original worth the hype,0.5717259449773766,0.998
744,Duck Duck Gooze,for purposes of this review 2013 was compared sidebyside to 2016  appearance the beer was a bright straw yellow with a bright white head  smell  the sour meshes with the oak  taste  this gueuze is so well balanced and far from acidic it is smooth and oaky with plenty of green apple 2016 is thinner and not a sour as 2013 to a degree the 2016 seems a bit watery 2016 even lingers during the 2013 sampling this is a green apple bonanza the sour oakinessthis linger so well  mouthfeel i am a little amazed at how well balanced this is it is sour but not burning acidic  overall this gueuze is out of this world,0.5716652561282308,0.7989

2602,Alter Ego,canned 82020 tasted 91720 surprising that its taken me this long to procure an alter ego this is a really yummy beer but its not as rich or flavorful as many other tree house offerings some folks really loved the smell of alter ego but i found this to be the weak spot in this beer it was a little murky and sour for my nose but the taste was delicious with a nice balance of dank bitterness and sweetcitrus fruit flavors the feel while a touch on the light side was very smooth the look was a slightly hazy orange  hazier than bright but less hazy than most other th ipas,0.5715555445016304,0.9001
5660,Tweak,sampling a 12 oz bottle from 2016 bottling says 175 abv on the label sounds like a winner for me the beer pours into my snifter a dark coffee brown color with no light passing through a surprisingly robust fluffy to spongelike head foams up 2 cm and hangs around as a sturdy surface layer surprised there is this much head for a high abv brew with 4 years in the bottle the nose on this one isboozy i get some dark bakers chocolate black coffee and a lot of bourbon and general boozy heat there is also a bit of dark fruit raisin and plum mixing and also some molasses notes definitely a big complex beer first sip reveals a lighter body than i expected and fine gentle rolling carbonation texture is kind of slick as it hits my mouth and slides down my throat too easy but there is also a sticky coating on my palate after each sip oh and rounding out the physical traits is some warming booze this kicks in right after the swallow and lingers in my mouth and down my throat to my belly yup big boozy beer flavor is malts and malts i dont get any hop character here i get dark chocolate and brown sugar up front this moves to some molasses and bourbon in the middle and finishes with more bourbon i think the coffee flavor has faded out over time definitely no hop character on the finish either this is a really nice sipping beer and seems just fine after 4 years in my cellar i am amazed at the head retention on this beer which is still a sturdy surface even at the end of my consumption very nice would buy again,0.5715366654638305,0.9783

4001,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,2016 variant drank on 422016  this is definitely a great beer due to the limited number of bottles the hype and asking price for this probably overrates this thing but it certainly is excellent it is probably best after completing warming because the peppers settle down a bit and the maple explodes the complexity of this is incredible notes of cinnamon peppers vanilla cinnamon coconut bourbon sweet dark chocolate maple oak molasses and so on its really great,0.5711656030704854,0.9849

840,Lou Pepe - Kriek,my favorite of the lou pepe series beautiful color and a tremendous sour cherry flavor not quite as rich as the hanssens oude schaarbeekse kriek nor as tart as lpf different fruit but naturally draws the comparison this beer provides a wonderful balance between funk and fruit a real treat that i hope to drink again sometime in the notsodistant future,0.5707188777658854,0.9417

352,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,little thin lacking the thicc sweetness of the past cinnaforward with some nice malty ris flavors fig raisin glad to tick it but wouldnt seek out again not at all the rating that would constitute a top 20 beer,0.5706286675866042,0.7351
3502,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,tons of dark chocolate and bourbon in the nose also a little vanilla leather and faint coffee the taste starts off with more of the big chewy chocolate accompanied by some nice bourbon heat unfortunately around midpalate there is a noticeable dropoff in the flavor profile subtle notes of vanilla and oak can be found but the overall complexity or lack thereof keeps this just outside elite status in my opinion although the heavy fudgy chocolate on the front end gives a nice impression of viscous creaminess it seems to finish a bit thin for the style i will say i was quite impressed by the abundance of bourbon character without feeling boozy or overwhelming overall its very very good and id happily drink another,0.5705216864146728,0.952
5100,Barrel Aged Bomb!,poured into a snifter like most other big prairie stouts a black pour with a minimal tan head which fades to a ring there is a pretty strong aroma the ancho chiles jump out at me but chocolate and whiskey are there in the background the taste is complex there is a hint of coffee present but whiskey and chocolate are most prominent with caramel malt vanilla oak notes and a touch of cinnamon following the whiskey is extremely wellmelded with the rest of the beer and is present midpalate through the finish the chiles are somewhat muted compared to the standard bomb but provide a nice warming heat at the finish the beer is full bodied incredibly smooth the entire way through and a touch boozy on the finish pretty incredible huge fan of prairies stouts but this one surpassed my expectations and blew me away,0.5705187463193127,0.9625
3041,Cable Car Kriek,had this side by side with 2013 regular cable car and veritas 012 a be warned this is a gusher we were aware of it so we opened it carefully enough to lose very few of it pours darker than veritas 012 reddish with a good white foam s smell is really complex although the cherry is not obvious the balance is awesome barnyard funk verry clean tart cherries come after with raspberries and minerals aromas reminiscent of the old 3f hommage for some reason t taste is more focused on the red fruits and some soaked fruits still very clean for an american wild ale lots of funk barnyard horse blanket hay sharp sourness no acidic acid no lactiness highly drinkable m well carbonated soft mouthfeel puckering sourness awesome o mindblowing beer very very surprising it brings cable car to another level and completely overwhelms the veritas 012 i am glad i was able to try this it certainly lives up to the hype,0.5704711458289914,0.9654
4365,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,one of the rare reviews ill do not from streamofconsciousness but rather from notes i wrote down i drank this can in the mountains a few hours ago in silence save for the rushing river next to me an experience  a world of thanks to jon for this can  pint can dated 101118  poured into a tulip at about 45 degrees  pours an unbelievable glowing neon orange juice color completely opaque creamy milky turbid murky all of it haze for dayz almost literally glows in the dark  nose has an undeniable dankness to it and some exotic floral notes i cannot place creamy and musty with round yeasty notes very unique hopping overall the nose is mellow but what it has going on is unique truly smells like a hop galaxy if that makes any sense i know it doesnt  palate is earthy eucalyptus lavendar manuka honey notes vanilla and some exotic floral accents that i have not experienced before moderate to decent sweetness in the middle and finishes with zero bitterness some douglas fir piney lemon dryness but absolutely no bitterness finishes floral pine eucalyptus and yeast notes vanilla lingers extremely long into the finish getting what i can only describe as a birthday cake note cake batter flavor profile is very round full floral earthy and impressions of sweet things without the sweetness  mouthfeel on this is truly divine and even goes toe to toe with julius luscious pillowy soft round full the word in a nutshell is fluffy this is a fluffy beer excellent carbonation gives it a touch of lift but doesnt sharpen it world class feel amazing  overall this is a phenomenal beer a truly delicious and pleasing beer satisfying exotic hops give unique floral impressions that i havent experienced before must be unique to galaxy restrained balanced and soft spoken it doesnt come out and demand you acknowledge its presence it remains quiet mysterious and alluring and waits for you to come to it recognizing its greatness on your own i enjoyed every last drop of this beer and will seek it out again at all costs you should too because it is a fantastic beer with a fantastic feel and some very unique character and nuance special,0.5703880211758449,0.9978
4945,Affogato,pours really dark brown with small mocha head very strong coffee on the nose good coffee notes on the palate and the alcohol is well hidden slightly sweeter but i didnt get the thick mouth feel that others claim didnt really pickup on the vanilla overall a well made beer but a little overpraised in my opinion,0.570333678034719,0.7541
4268,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),the beer pours a foamy and heavy head with a light brown note to it the beer itself is a dark brown color that is opaque and looks very nice the smell is pretty good it has an earth floral hop note upfront that mixes well with the darker and roasted toffee notes with a fresh plum note in the finish the taste is roughly the same but a stronger and more bitter hop note with a light burnt belgian sugar towards the end but ending with the hop note there is a light toffee note with a bit of berry underneath all of the hop notes though it does get buried at times one thing to note is that the notes change as the beer warms up when it warms up the hop notes recedes into the background a bit and brings forth the malt and toffee notes the feeling is pretty good it has a nice silky and cream texture to it even thought it comes off as watery on and off the carbonation is light and soft there is a slight dryness in the finish overall this a pretty good beer and worth drinking its a simple beer that manages to be pretty good without having to turn into a frankensteins monster with different ingredients,0.5702896338891266,0.9912

6096,Blanc De Blancs,nice oaky chardonnay aroma but far too acetic in the taste and while it raised a nice head in doing so it seemed to lose most of its carbonation leaving the beer somewhat flat by the time of drinking,0.5702701025800538,0.2617

2762,Mexican Brunch,pours a touch thin but that is to be expected considering it is a porter sits cola brown and opaque in the glass with light khaki foam around the edge of the glass at first the smell is lactose sweet but as it warms up you get some strong chocolate notes and just a hint of chili pepper the smell did not prepare you for the explosion of taste when you finally sip it sweet chocolate on the front end with a sweet cinnamon center not really any heat to speak of but there are some pepper notes not really any specific maple flavor but it is definitely sweet it feels a touch watery but still has a modicum of body overall this beer is excellent tastes more like an italian capuccino than a mexican stout but i am not complaining,0.5702647750074149,0.9908

3973,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),a served draft at the brewery into a long stem tulip glass intensely dark with a massive tan head that lingered leaving great lacing clear side note this beer was from a separate tap served warmer than others  s supreme sweetness and bourbon molasses toffee roasty malt  t like a marshmallow chocolate milkshake with a hit of coffee and a generous pour of high quality bourbon a hop snuck in there at the end to remind me this is a beer  m thick milkshake with no taste of alcohol  o i almost wish i hadnt tried this because i think it ruined me every other barrel aged imperial stout will now be judged against this sorry kbs i still love you,0.5700051604028981,0.9724

2110,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,oh hell this is one glorious beer which delivers on all levels spot on chewy mouth feel and the vanilla helps round out the finish nose hides the alcohol well and vanilla is the predominant note although the taste is full if rich fudge syrupy vanilla rad note of barrel char and devils cut would always enjoy this and happy to try or buy again,0.5697763811375018,0.8074

590,Double Sunshine,pint can  dated 043020  poured into an ipa glass at 38f  pours a nearcrystal clear earthy pale amber hue topped with three fingers of dense sticky pure white head with excellent retention plentiful visible effervescence very nice lacing left behind  nose very similar to sip of sunshine but more pliny this definitely has more of a malt presence than sip light notes of caramel and brown sugar beneath big pacific northwest hop notes lots of pine lots of hoppy resins huge grapefruit some stone fruit in the form of peach and mango a touch of tropical pineapple and some earthy dank simcoe its surprisingly subdued  not as inyourface as heady topper but a similar profile not as fruity and new england  palate this is where it gets interesting i was beginning to think this would just be a maltier sip of sunshine no no no first sip and im immediately taken back by the punishing bitterness it holds no punches and immediately slaughters the palate with biting resinous bitterness right from the start this thing is hopped to high hell it does have a fuller bolder sweeter malt presence than sip but it needs it to support that insane bite flavourwise lots of caramel malt upfront and then pine sap resinous piney bitter pine sap theres a big pithy grapefruit note as well just about as bitter and pithy as biting into actual grapefruit rind holy moly there are whispers of fruit notes beneath the assault of all things hoppy and bitter with the suggestion of some peach apricot mango and pineapple but thats quickly whisked away when that signature earthy boiled simcoe note comes in giving a huge nod to pliny  if pliny was on that barry bonds love potion number 9 joose its like getting pulled over after a high speed car chase even though all you did was run a stop sign sure you can surrender but youre getting pummeled either way and its gonna hurt it finishes leaving you somewhat violated with that earthy dank simcoe pine sap and pithiness now without the grapefruit flavour the bitterness claws into your tongue eventually fading away like the heat of a bhut jolokia  mouthfeelbody the beer is fairly full in part due to its malt base but even without the weight of the malt with a level of bitterness like a kick from a mule straight to your naddy daddies this one will stop you like a 50cal barrett not a midsummer day quaffer this is for when you want it to hurt and you want it bad effervescence is fairly lively once you survive the bitter assault long enough to realise its actually effervescent very little malt cloy or cling but it leaves a kiss of stickiness on the lips and of course the bitterness lingers with no sign of leaving like a transient after youve said sure you can spend the night in my basement and not do any drugs at all typical classic double ipa body with typical classic trouble ipa bitterness some hop burn will in fact start to hurt the upper hard palate after a while  overall goodness gracias my i have another señor this one really packs a hidden whopper and not like those chicks in bankok either on the surface it masquerades as a harmless little hybrid double ipa but then when you taste it theres clearly something very different about it it really shares a lot in common with pliny the elder in terms of its flavour profile it has those signature sosheady colours but the bitterness here is on another level really making this a beast all its own its a fantastic beer and its certainly unique if you want a classic og hop assault and you have the grip not to drop the soap give this one a try just dont say i didnt warn you,0.569691423286723,-0.9007
855,JJJuliusss!,theres some subtle differences between this and the base beer  first its muddier in appearance second the nose is more earthy and not as brightly citrusy finally the body seems heartier and the malt has a stronger backbone  the plusses and minuses equal a push in my book,0.5696733076735381,0.1255
5469,Coconut B-Bomb,appearance  the beer poured a silky black color with a dark tan head crowning the glass  smell  coconut was evident in the nose but did not jump out as much as i imagined it would  taste  as expected coconut was a big part of the initial taste dark chocolate followed seeming to be actual chocolate the profile was very smooth with bourbon notes adding to the smoothness there was nothing hot about this beer  mouthfeel  little carbonation bubbles contributed to the silkiness it was a step away from nitro  overall  i enjoyed the fact that the beer was not overly sweet this one is a keeper,0.5696360880630088,0.3027
5247,Sosus,over the past few weeks i seem to be blindly picking some of the bestranked drinks on this platform this one definitely falls into that category  huge citrus open and pour generous grapefruit  pineapple front end with hints of mango and kiwi luxurious milky feel in the mouth and swallow light green dank balanced with grain on the exhale  world class imbibe indeed,0.5695570092396852,0.8074
311,Fundamental Observation,pours a straight black with light tan lacing low carb but enough to avoid a flat finish vanilla is present on the nose and overall vanilla held up very well despite being 4 years old now mouth feel is velvety smooth barrel is almost gone and oddly couldve used a smidge more heat to balance the slight sweetness but this was excellent overall super easy drinking,0.5695336332757359,0.9652

4829,Matt,2013 vintage drank in a snifter 4122016  lrich and dark dark brown with a minimal head and thick lacing  sscotch caramel and a little sweet booze the belgian candy sugar is noticeable here for sure  tthis is where it becomes exceptional super complex this mainly is the rating at about room temperature because it kept getting so much better as it warmed that i saved most of it after about sitting 45 minutes smooth apple brandy mixed with rich caramel bourbon oak some fig and other dark fruits as well  fsmooth no heat minimal booze goes down really nice the richness doesnt make it super drinkable but i wouldnt want that in this type either really enjoyable  oa highly unique and complex beer that is done about as well as i could imagine really exceptional the apple brandy barrel does overpower the bourbon barrel but who doesnt love apple brandy not as much smoke as expected but thats nitpicking this is exactly what i want in a barrel aged strong ale,0.5694877605991095,0.9587
234,SR-71,pours thick and black with a thin dark brown head that fades to a dark brown ring around the glass the aroma is chocolate vanilla and bourbon the taste is chocolate marshmallow vanilla lots of barrel but not boozy there also seems to be some smokiness on the finish its a little on the sweet side but not overly sweet the mouthfeel is thick overall this beer is a work of art like kbbs i was worried that it was overhyped but also like kbbs that is not the case this beer is as close to perfect as a barrelaged stout can be,0.5694438050465739,0.9039
2300,Abricot Du Fermier,pours a beautiful golden  surprising clarity id expected more yeast suspension immediately after popping the cap apricot permeated the air  it has a tremendous nose clean and tart and fruity the taste follows suit  tart sour full of apricots rich yet not the yeasty beast that i had anticipated finish is fairly clean as well which is surprised me a bit this is quite likely one of my top 3 beers from side project at this point  id gladly trade for more any day,0.5693864546609937,0.9725
42,Marshmallow Handjee,for purposes of the review both 2017 and 2018 were sampled together  appearance  the beer had the vicious blackness of dark lord  smell  the 2018 had more sweet chocolate marshmallow 2017 leaned more earthy and dry but still had an overall sense of sweetness  taste  the 2018 had amazing notes of toasted marshmallow chocolate syrup vanilla and char in back the 2017 was not as sweet but still had notes of sweet vanilla and chocolate in both bottles there was a sweet quality of kids breakfast cereals amazing there is almost no burn from the 15 abv  mouthfeel  on par with motor oil the beer has amazing thickness it clings like few others  overal  holy diabetes the beer should be too sweet but it is so good further it appears the beer is best consumed fresh,0.5693758896221255,0.9939

4834,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,pours a turbid and opaque color of grapefruit juice with over a finger of head surprisingly the first note that i got on the nose was dankness secondary on the nose are the citrus notes  the flavor is juicy with solid citrusy notes the finish is pithy and decently bitter  the body is light for the style and the abv is wellhidden if motivated i could slam the whole fourpack then id probably fall over,0.5691879168412065,0.1027
518,Zenne Y Frontera,sorry contillon and bokkenrijder this is the best lambic i have had worth the hunt worth the money worth every single minute you give it wow it is almost hard to put into words how much is going on yet so much on a delicate scale plenty of sweeter red wine elements grapes sherry booze lemon plus other fruits like orange peach and pear then there is the hay earthy and beet sugar base that crops up in fun and balanced sips plenty of funk barrel elements and oak to boot little bit of everything amazing,0.5691801010177047,0.9686
4442,Hold On To Sunshine,l a dark brown to black with a reddish hint at the fringe a near equally dark half finger of fizzy head that disappears quickly and leaves no trace  s primarily fudge but some earthy roasted peanuts in there and a dark fruit tart note  t follows the nose mostly fudgy but the tartness while i expect it is coffee is coming off as dark cherries in the way you pick this up in a belgian dark ale ot black ale a little more eastern european and not my thing very sweet  nearly cloyingly and not balanced by enough bitterness  f syrupy and a touch oily with a heavy medium weight could use more carbonation still inline with many of the same style  o personally shocked that this is ranked 2 with all the other amazing milk stouts that tree house has made i would put several others at that ranking over this that said tree house is the king of the style,0.5691336143227737,0.5913
3270,Bomb!,theres good carbonation despite absolutely no head in the clear pint glass after this was emptied from a twelve ounce brown bottle a hot peppery smell dominates and behind it some roasted malt and chocolate the color of this brew is the common black coffee and without any head nor lacing this looks like it could be a black coffee soda but the taste is so much more complex and interesting first this is incredibly smooth for a laceless stout it has a very good body rich and velvety across the tongue theres much to taste mostly chocolate somehow neither sweet nor bitter a hint of vanilla and just a little peppery heat its definitely not a burn just a little heat actually theres more pepper to the nose than to the taste but thats ok why argue with a near perfect balance absolutely no clue that this rings in with an astonishing 13 abv this might not be the best brew youve ever had but it is certainly one you must try should the chance arise,0.5691262160853979,0.9674
4457,Leaner,sample pour from a 9l bottle at sp 3rd anniversary party pours a hazy juicy orange with soapy white head nice collar of white on this one after the initial foam from the pour dies down smells of peach candy oak a hint of white wine and perhaps even a little graham cracker crust taste is sweet peach candy up front with the oak on the backend its got a nice sourness to it mouthfeel was full well carbonated extremely tasty i love sps versions of leaner and caseys was just as good been a long while since i have had any casey damn good stuff,0.5691055319752089,0.9636

2671,Black Tuesday - Reserve,got this one from claaark13 a while back cheers  from a 750 into a snifter 2015 edition imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels  appearance pours out a clear brown and yields a small loose bubbly light beige head that quickly vanishes to a bubbly ring bistre brown body with no carbonation evident ring disappears rather quickly leaving this one looking flat and lifeless until the end  smell big bourbon and oak nose on this one boozy for sure with lots of candylike qualities as well vanilla coconut milk chocolate and molasses come through with toffee and butterscotch notes a slight hint of roasted malt and pure chocolate behind the onslaught of bourbon and oak all over the place  taste piles of bourbon here lots of bourbon and oak flavors really strong and boozy some vanilla coconut and milk chocolate up front as well moving into a boozy finish bold aftertaste of bourbon vanilla coconut lots of wood and spirit some pure chocolate bitterness and a touch of roasted malt lingers on the palate lots of booze  palate medium body and medium carbonation silky on the palate goes down with a good scratch and burn at the swallow and finishes quite sticky on the palate harsh and lots of heat lingers this feels more like whisky than beer though it is surprisingly silky and smooth especially as it settles  overall this is closer to straight spirit than any other incarnation of this beer either that or ive become a huge sissy since i last had one of these a couple years back probably a combination of the two it seems like the extra barrel aging which was totally unnecessary in the first place has made this one even hotter and boozier than the base amazing but yes its boozier than the base im never sure what to think about this bruiser i admit i find it rather delicious and actually crave it from time to time but its questionable at best as an imperial stout and as a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout i often wonder where the stout went from my notes and memory the 2009 original bottling was one of the best things to ever grace my belly and unfortunately the successors havent quite lived up to that heavenly experience all that said this is probably the beer i most look forward to imbibing in again weird enjoyable for sure but be ready with an army of the willing at your back or a solid wine stopper so you can plug it up and enjoy it for a couple weeks thanks again claaark always a pleasure,0.5690666402259928,0.9971
1078,Double Citra®,found this beer in brooklyn and had a 82520 production date  pours hazy yellow with just the right head smell is subdued but the first sip is chock full of citrus and a bit of bitterness which departs quickly each sip gets better and the mouthfeel is quite something makes you want to return for another sip to experience its nuances great take on citra hops and have one more to try this weekend,0.5690556056754142,0.8126
1992,Resolute - Coconut,2019 vintage appearance is dark  near black 23 finger head that quickly dissipates roasted notes galore but very minimal coconut considering most coconut beers ive had this is about as light as it gets light barrel notes could use a lot more barrel or vanillin to balance the amount of roast in this beer full bodied but just not really all that impressive i have a hard time believing this remains a top 100 beer extremely disappointed,0.5690318240658222,0.2158
1507,Lou Pepe - Framboise,a 2010 vintage generously shared with me after quite literally years of anticipating this bottle together its incredible stuff worth the wait and as good as anything i have had from these guys really every bit as good as the lou kriek or the fou deep dusty brick red in color dense with fruit here not as electric and bright looking as a lot of raspberry beers and with a fizzy lazy head not super robust there the nose is mind melting for me pure raspberry and insanely mature lambic funk and tartness turbid wheaty aged hop base tons of oak and brett a well developed wild acidity as well this is rather piquant and then of course all the berry as natural as it gets and like stuffing an entire handful of them in my face as intense as can be i smell it for awhile before i taste it so complex and mouthwatering and inviting great sourness up front in the flavor highlights the fruit right from the start with the sturdy wood and mature wildness right there with it tart and red winey towards the finish a little sweet from the fruit still malty in a lambic sense and really brightly acidic and interesting the complexity of the yeast elements here is as good as it gets and why cantillon is so well regarded as far as i am concerned the raspberries are perfect with it and really bold in this beer the maturity is unrivaled and the flavor is just incredible beautiful lambic famous for a reason and probably even more striking to me now in terms of quality because there are so many lackluster fruited sours out there in the world this is the cream,0.5690022361017696,0.9941

3277,Bomb!,2020 brew poured jan 2021 into own brewery goblet jet black with insignificant head and no effervesence light fragrance spices riding on coffee sweet lead immediatly followed by bitter espresso and milk chocolate raisins and a hint of port wine there is a persistent bitterrness on the long finish with a subtle ancho chili burn that is accentuated if you take a quick second sip mouthfeel is on the lighter side but carries great depth of flavor with no reliance on barrel aging a very well made beer and i was very impressed by the sublety of the chili too much coffee for my taste that left an unpleasant bitterness on the finish interesting but not one i would rush to seek out will leave the other one in the cellar a few months and see if it improves,0.5689314411929378,0.8618

2954,Coconut Vibes,coconut vibes b3 bottle i purchased from side project the cellar  pours a very deep dark black with unusual lacing foam which dissipates relatively quickly this leaves the just the black liquid with fine coconut bits that you could see floating around very fine size really aroma has coconut galore and milk chocolate milk chocolate coconut liquified almond joy bar is what popped into my mind as i took first sip nutty and sweet yet it works super well integrated coconut no hint of artificial flavor at all thick  compared to b2 this still has a load of coconut aroma flavor etc everywhere but i think somehow is also a bit restrained relative to b2 i prefer this batch to the b2   coconut vibes b2 bottle i purchased from side project the cellar  this looked extremely dark and caramel colored brown foam very unusual related to typical foam i see the smell was huge amount of toasted coconut it smelled up my whole room upon the pour taste was well more coconut than any beer ive had and its not even close it was loads and loads of creamy coconut to go along with chocolate very rich and very sweet feel is among the thickest beers ive ever had probably top 3 its a crazy tasty beer thats very sweet this is the epitome of a dessert stout thats meant to be shared,0.5688508016972739,0.9825
2405,Saison Du Fermier,b1 slight gusher but it just flooded the immediate area with floral and citrus aromas a closer whiff reveals the typical sp rustic characteristics though this seems to be much fruitier than some of their other offerings at least the few ive had its almost like sticking your head inside of a used wine barrel not sour but tarter in taste than the nose lends one to believe but fits well with the fruitiness reminiscent of a gewürztraminer,0.568767538733047,0.6663

1591,Nectarine Premiere,this one has been on my most wanted list for awhile so huge thanks to my boy for scoring this for us to share what a gem its as good as i hoped it would be the nectarine popping in here natural and juicy the essence of the fruit as so many de garde beers deliver and it seems right in its peak bottle from september 2020 pale brew with some haze through most of the bottle very fizzy but not holding a ton of head and a nose that my mouth is still watering from wow its puckery nectarous and juicy ripe and sweet and sour at the same time wood heavy fully wild incredible aroma here and it gets better as it warms more fruit more funk more wood the flavor is fantastic the fruit hits mostly at the end its mature vinous funky wild beer up front slightly raw on the grain side maybe some unmalted wheat in here pils malt doughy and crackery and simple but earthy the ferment is sharp but not overly sour tannic from the oak maybe some white wine character too lots of well developed bretty funk too when the fruit hits its like taking a bite of a ripe nectarine and it stays on the tongue through the finish impressively real forward and its crazy this is as dry as it is because the fruit is so sweet amazing this has already developed well in the bottle but i think its safe to say even more time would evolve it further its maybe not as complex on the yeast side as my favorite de garde beers but the fruit element is as good as it gets great carbonation here too lively and excited feeling on the palate fits the summery fruitiness loved this very thankful i know this is one of their highest rated beers but its probably not even in my top five from them amazing as it is,0.5686322507391437,0.9985
3026,Grey Monday,2017 release 200 abv  the pour is a dark brown with a distinct crimson hue hardly any head appears but what does bubble up is a nice ivory color thin and spaced out quick to disappear  as was expected this thing is boozy with lots of dark fruit right away on the nose as it warms bourbon and oak come forth with some urgency the booze is still overwhelming but the subtly complex aromas that come peeking through that ethanol are pleasant and chocolate in particular becomes gradually more prevalent  in the flavors you get more of that powerful booziness but it is not as overwhelming as the nose oak and bourbon is noticeable with that stinging alcohol quick to follow it up as it warms you get some nuttiness but cant really pick out hazelnuts specifically hazelnuts are one of those nuts that can be potent in a beer but even just a year bottle conditioning with an abv that high can swallow up some of the originally intended components  the body on grey monday is thin but with a syrupy feel and a low carbonation sharp stinging booze is present throughout and makes for a hot finish closer to the liquor end of the spectrum than beer honestly,0.5686312595897662,0.9422
4758,Last Snow,from a bottle into a snifterthis is a really great use of coconut probably the best use that ive come acrossnot overdone but really solid and layered also some slightly bitter coffee notes that harmonize really nicely and some other sweet and gentle spicy notes too smooth and creamy mouthful that still manages to come to a nice clean finish this is a good one,0.568603991126598,0.9851
4719,Crusher,i picked up a 4pack of this at the brewery on 20may19 and set out to quaff a couple in the zebo on 27may19  it was a deep golden color like apricot jam had steady carbo and a frothy lighttan head the topping was a healthy 1 and ebbed back quite slowly with excellent lacing on the glass had a citrussy nose with apricot and tangerine all over body was mediumplus and it was rather smooth overall  flavor had more semisweet fruit  tangerine and apricot once more plus a smidge of bittering fruit like grapefruit and pineapple it was also resiny dank and a little piney before finishing on the dry side a wonderful mix indeed prosit  footnote rather enjoyed my memorial day beers but later on i bounded down into the cellar stepped wrong on a step and broke a small bone in my left foot ouch  4315 rdev 38 look 45  smell 4  taste 45  feel 425  overall 425  2082,0.5686007835622479,-0.0305

5846,Sang Noir,this was a huge beer it was incredibly thick and heavy on the palate which is why i knocked a few points off the feel as it was way too heavy for a sour that said it was well executed you can taste all of the elements involved the spiced red ale base blends together well with the bourbon and wine barrels the sour bite comes on strong with the finish,0.5684906153933275,0.8316

2714,Notorious Triple IPA,a great looking ipa nice clear orange with decent head smells of tropical fruit grapefruit dank but a bit muted taste follows not sure if they sent a fresh keg to shelton festival will have to revisit out west but this fell short of they hype for me,0.5682666206717352,0.8767
5184,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,purchased from a private collector for 17 this is 2016 vintage comes in a ridiculously huge 192 oz can pours out deep dark brown gorgeous color the head rises up a full 2 inches but subsides to a quarter of an inch after about 30 seconds the remainder stays for quite a while a dark tan smell is a nice blend of burned caramel toffee chocolate nut and bourbon the taste is rather incredible notes of raisin and cherry are present as well as the flavors apparent in the smell the bourbon presence is huge and rather dominates this brew there is also quite a bit of bitterness in the wash on its way down my throat mouthfeel is lively and mediumbodied with a fair amount of carbonation present overall im quite pleased with this its a very sticky beer but not overly sweet perfect for a nice night of music making,0.568257759967144,0.9439
2029,Keene Idea,poured from 64oz growler into tulp crystal clear orange in color with white head that vanished quickly i believe because i didnt get to open it soon enough smells of tropical fruit pineapple and citrus ice lacing and great tasting beer at a 88 piney and hoppy would like to get some bottle to beable to get the full flavor im a nelson guy myself but another great ipa from alpine,0.5682488445820288,0.8945
1432,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,on tap at the recent hotd fredfest event  the beer pours a somewhat murky orange chocolate brown color with good head retention and lacing on the nose its apparent this has seen some pretty serious barrel aging as i pick up considerable vanilla caramel light bourbon molasses and light coffee the flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this sweet rich beer and i appreciated how well integrated the alcohol was in this beer you can definitely tell the abv is up there but i would never have guessed 17 the sweetness wears on your after a bit so a little bit goes a long way but this is otherwise a very impressive ba barleywine from anchorage brewing mouthfeel is very full soft and long on the palate  excellent beer for sure and one that reminded me very much of the fremont brew 1000 from a couple years back not as much bourbon as the b1000 i suppose but pretty similar otherwise definitely a treat to see this fine beer at fredfest this year,0.5681202890348727,0.9917
261,Very Hazy,pours like it says very hazy with a light orangeyellow color that you cant see through at all light white head that fades quickly and leaves a little lacing down the glass smells of citrus and melon and some sweetness at the end taste is equally pleasing with big grapefruit orange notes up front and finishes with a melon and a bit grassy lawn at the end smooth perfect amount of carbonation well done,0.5680661280780691,0.9313
4443,Hold On To Sunshine,appearance  the beer poured a murky deep black color with a dark tan head  smell  the beer smelled like peanuts covered in dark chocolate the chocolate largely dominated  taste  so i was not really in the mood to risk anaphylactic shock tonight so i deferred the chocolate profile was very smooth with roasted peanuts the profile did not lend it self to peanut butter the aftertaste was very sweet clearly signifying that this is a desert stout  mouthfeel  the field was smooth and silky almost to the point of being velvety  overall  still there was some thing about this one that i could not enjoy namely a food allergy and the cost of an epipen kept me from enjoying it,0.5680632576959778,0.761
3962,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),poured a pitch black small amount of mocha head smells incredible with lots of bourbon but not overpowering taste is complex and nuanced probably due to the extended time in the barrel and it lasts a long time after finishing a sip feel is very smooth and coats the mouth overall a standout nonadjunct barrel aged stout,0.5680227399864094,0.2617
2764,Mexican Brunch,2017 vintage i won the lottery then we all got our money back kane is ridiculously awesome for doing that for the record 1 of my 5 bottles ended up with the surge problem still tested the same great taste  so this is morning bell which i love as is with maple syrup cinnamon and chili  l 2f tan head with moderate retention leaves little lacing but a cap and ring beer is jet black  s coffee dairy lactose cinnamon maple cocoa explosion just off the hook what perfect scores were made for  t generally speaking follows nose coffee cinnamon and roasted malts up front cocoa and maple through middle along with creamy dairy and slight chili heat in finish along with some burned malts and caramel full of flavor  f medium to full bodied not much carbonation construction superb balance of all these things strong but tiny dock for heat lingering maybe longer than it should  o just ridiculously good and kane deserves so much credit for or how it handled this year and now to find sunday brunch to complete the journey,0.5680107870360472,0.9837

1046,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,i finally got to try this whale after a trade i thought it was similar to abraxas i had a 2017 and may have bunkered it too long with the flavors becoming much more mild than other reviewers indicate  honestly ive had plenty of other better beers within this category that are not on the top 250 list such as prison barrel aged wham whams or some of the evil twin or j wakefield stouts  beer pours black with a caramel color head smell of pepper and vanilla but very subtle i was expecting a much stronger nose  good solid thick mouthfeel similar to chocholate fudge but no tingling from the peppers i wanted something stronger and more flavorful,0.5678642373517826,0.8203
3037,Grey Monday,reviewed on 122517 2017 bottle l  pours a dark caramel color with a minuscule fizzy mocha head s  upon opening the bottle and got a big blast of sugary hazelnuts but in the glass the beer smells like black tuesday t  there is classic black tuesday sweetness and a little bitter boozy notes finish is a little nutty f  the mouth feel is a little thin but sticky finish is dry and a little astringent definitely has chest heat o  i dont think this is much better than black tuesday the hazelnuts are a unique variation but i dont think there is as much depth,0.5678560378973786,0.9227
2488,Sunday Brunch,smell was awesome nice cinnamon and maple the initial flavor was what threw me almost like an apply flavor in the front that melded into a maple bomb smelled great initial flavor not great back end flavor decent 36  edit tried it for a second time and i think my first bottle was a bad one everything came together very nicely with all the flavors no apple but lots of maple and cinnamon great beer,0.5678263528408657,0.8501
1700,Green,65 week old can poured into a teku  full haze in the glass but no murk looks simultaneously juicy and creamy typical light gold coloring with some orange highlights on initial pour theres a finger of bigbubble soapy eggshell head with minimal retention splotches of cloudy lacing as i drink the first half pouring out the rest later slightly warmer the head is much creamier and holds up much longer with similar lacing results  very green grassy citrusy and sappy on the nose lots of fruit notes ranging from sweet orange to pineapple white grape to cantaloupe some generic tropical fruit salad and grapefruit mildly weedy and dank some peach juice sugared berries and 7up lemonlime make an appearance late a familiar juicy fruit gum is present as well very nice aroma profile but my initial impression is that it simply doesnt stand out in the modern haze world as the beer warms that impression changes as the various components grow stronger and blend together masterfully the greenness really starts to stand out but it is balanced well by the various fruit components most of which lend an attractive sweet juiciness to the overall experience really outstanding and i bet early on the the emergence of hazie ipas this one was viewed as an absolute knockout  the taste profile is shockingly dry and green theres moderate bitterness which for a hazie is unique but we certainly arent talking about west coast ipa bitterness quite pithy with a strong mineral note there is almost zero residual sweetness which for me is a negative but is clearly what theyre after given the name or perhaps the name was simply formed given the result of the beer i like green weedy elements in these types of beer when there is fruit and other sweetness to balance things out but here the green ends up being a touch abrasive because theres simply nothing else to pay attention to to its credit there are still a number of fruit components to the taste profile with orange pineapple grape peach apricot and mango being clear enough to pick out behind the greenery but each is extremely underripe and sharp with again almost no sweetness to it the biggest kick comes from the strong grapefruit which i like a lot because it naturally fits with the pithy bitter almost stinging overall personality and while there are plenty of modern hazies that have sharp green taste profiles that burn and are extremely starchy andor vegetal this is completely different  its a kin to pure squeezed underripe grapefruit juice that is clean fruit and pith with no sweetness credit to tree house for the naturalness of the fruit flavors but you are almost waiting for some natural sweetness to appear and it simply never does i am really fascinated by this beer and i see why it is sought after and loved its just not what i expected even with the name green and isnt really what i look for in a ne ipa just a touch of sweetness would take this beer to another level as it is i find it a little harsh simply dominated by grassy greens and bitter grapefruit but it is still interestingly complex and certainly true to its name  soft silky but a little prickly from both the moderate carbonation and green taste elements zero alcohol heat incredible lingering grapefruit pith nice coating on the teeth and tongue without any aspect of stickiness or chewiness,0.5677175077862532,0.9977
3931,Double Dry Hopped Mylar Bags,from the dc brewery their first run of ddh mylar bags  4pk of 16oz cans two beers consumed 31721 canned on 31021 16oz english pint glass as with any oh beers i review i am fortunate that i am reviewing all of their beers from 3 days to 1 week after canning  in short this is one of the best hazy ipas i have ever tried great job dc for living up to one of the most famous oh beers from brooklyn  a  cloudy very hazy strawgoldish overall hue skewing towards peach and apricot in color twofinger head upon pouring quickly reduces to thin head that clings to glass all the way down lace is comprised of tight bubbles  s  smell is 425 when first poured from refrigerator gets better after warming up a tad tropical fruit orange oil and a hint of spiciness on nose pleasing but not an indication of the flavor explosion to come  t  boom let this warm just a tad after removing from refrigerator tropical fruits very much mango forward hit you in the kisser right away almost overpowering if the flavors werent encased in a smooth velvet glove after the initial mango surge flavors transition into cantaloupe watermelon rind and pink grapefruit oilespecially pink grapefruit pith the oily and slightly bitter grapefruit pith are both flavors and texturaland linger in the mouth for over a minute after swallowing under all of this is a subtle mint note that glides under the more noticeable flavors as well as just enough hop bitterness to create tension to the fruit flavorsand this quality elevates this beer over the total fruit bowl experience of ddh broccoli imo  f  creamy and velvety smooth up front and quite oily expressed fruit rind on the finish but never heavy dangerously crushable at 850 abv  o  my favorite oh beer i have yet to try up to 28 oh makes a lot of very high quality beer but this one in particular is both contemplative very crushable and refreshing at the same time all at 85 abv i am no beer expert and my palate is not as blessed as many but after well over 1000 beers over 30 years of drinking craft beer this is among the 25 or so best beers i have yet to try a world class beer and something anyone should buy as soon as they see it get it fresh,0.567699402311709,0.9757
892,Parabola,black motor oil with a great nose of roasty chocolate and bourbon the taste is quite similar my bottle has been aged a bit so its got some oxidation great beer pick one up if you see it,0.567632139150212,0.8481
1000,Zombie Dust,12 oz can 07012021  poured into a pint glass a golden orange with a slight haze one finger head  good lace retention ill have to say i feel like i forgot what a pale ale is supposed to taste or smell like these last 5 or so years this one has an aroma of pine herbal tea notes and some orange notes the taste is right in line balanced with a firm malt backbone the feel is medium carbonation is medium overall one of the better pale ales i have had in a while that didnt pretend to be a hazy ipa,0.5675891537803607,0.8072
2946,Coconut Vibes,sweet af but you know that going in the coconut is on point body thick and oily still super sweet while the coconut is prominent there is a lot more going on with bittersweet chocolate muted coffee and some sweetness overall a great beer but definitely for sharing,0.5675780646402587,0.9862
4531,Impermanence,excellent head production and good retention overall an attractive beer  tons of maple on the nose its definitely the dominant characteristic followed by coffee and the rich malt base i dont get much chocolate standing out from the malt  flavor is more balanced up front its a stout through and through the maple doesnt take long to show its presence but its a bit woodier and far less sweet than the nose this is certainly amplified by the bitterness of the coffee and chocolate the result is more in line with a breakfast beer a la maple bacon coffee porter than a dessert beer  which seems to be the goal based on the description  maple wood semisweet chocolate coffee toffee molasses cream the flavor really grows i wasnt blown away by the first sip but im liking it more and more  an easy trap for a beer like this is to go overboard on the sweetness while the maple winds up being the star as so often is the case when adding maple syrup its still a pretty wellbalanced beer with plenty of bitterness its very approachable for a beer verging on double digit abv it lets you know its pretty big but it doesnt hit you over the head with it,0.5675478809547284,0.9833
609,Bourbon County Brand Stout,2017 vintage l black kind of tan head s hint of smoke to it caramel and dark chocolate t this one hits a little boozier than other iterations ive had has the chocolate real classic caramel and vanilla barrel characteristics f mouthfeel on thicc but not quite oily as others say carries the heavy flavors along perfectly oldest bcbs ive had so far not my favorite but it holds up to the others,0.5675053150449229,0.6788

4488,Double Barrel Jesus,poured into a snifter the appearance was a thick dark brown to motor oil black color with a fingers worth of tan foamy head that slid off at a mild pace some stringy lace concaved at the sides the aroma leaned to the sweeter side  thick with pure chocolate fudge milk chocolate cake sugar and some whiskey at the end the flavor was sweet all of the way through pulling in that cakelike taste to give off a bigger and fuller aftertaste that somewhat reminded me of whiskey soaked fudge the mouthfeel was full bodied with a pure sipping quality about it because the abv is not only felt but somewhat noticeable in its heat carbonation felt fine finish was thick and sweet overall diabetes in a bottle a 22 oz bottle can be tough to take down but i did over the course of a 4 hour period not for the faint of heart i suggest to share with a buddy,0.56737651994855,0.9477
5907,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,2020 vintage drank february 18th 2020 sadly this bottle leaked quite a bit in transit  carb was nearly absent but the taste and nose were terrific light bodied tart and super smooth with that low carb it reminded me a bit of a geuze minus the apple notes its only mildly sour and just a bit funky i really liked this one  wish it hadnt leaked so heavily,0.56734302720632,0.9416
1168,Maman,2017 vintage  smell the barrel is the star of the show on the nose the whiskey that comes through is so smooth and strong its singes the nose hairs in the best way there also a little bit of spice coming through as well a touch of vanilla coconut tobacco oak and leather also there are some underlying chocolate notes dark chocolate and coco powder this beer smells like a grade a whiskey with beer attributes this smells so strong and so damn amazing  taste right upfront the beer hits with big chocolate notes dark chocolate brownie batter and dusty coco powder the beer transitions to the mid palette where your hit with some dark fruit plum fig raisin as well as a touch of vanilla the barrel starts to make an assertive presence as well i get some whiskey leather and tobacco that carry on throughout the finish in the finish this beer is all barrel whiskey oak coconut leather tobacco maple syrup rye spice and a touch of dark cherry round out this beautiful beer the whiskey and barrel notes linger in the aftertaste  feel full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation the beer is smooth but drinks big this is definitely a classic example of a sipper  overall this is a wonderful beer that highlights everything a whiskey barrel has to offer if you dont like whiskey you probably wont enjoy this because it is the start of the show the whiskey barrel is really smooth and present but it never gets to hot and still allows for the beer to be there in the background overall this is a 100100 to me but is it worth the high trading price tag probably not barrel aged sump is just as good if not better in my opinion and it goes for a lot less still this is an amazing beer that is worth getting if your willing to pay the price of admission,0.5673395282027114,0.9807
4552,Impermanence,ive never been a stout fan until now the complexity of this beer was off the charts overwhelming chocolate flavor with a beautiful undertone of maple syrup this synergy of flavor made it perfect as a postdinner beer i felt like i was having dessert on a fluffy chocolate cloud as i licked maple syrup off of my favorite model hints of vanilla permeated through my nostrils a truly unique beer and a truly unique experience,0.5672729904428425,0.9622
5176,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,original rating l45 s475 t475 f45 o50  476  review canned 011521 consumed 020121  l pours a deep gold with a mediumfull haze an aggressive pour yields a pillowy 2 fingers of fine offwhite head the retention is excellent with the head never really dying and taking forever to settle down the head is sticky and leaves beautiful webs of lacing as i drink the beer  s i get citrus orange orange pith and grapefruit tropical fruits mango papaya and a hint of pineapple and a light grainy malt  t waves of citra are washing over the palate supported by a nice grainy malt backbone i get orange pith morphing into orange creamsicle on the front end the mid palate presents the grainy malt character that is complemented here by some grapefruit on the back end the tropical fruits come in with mango and pineapple on the finish the tropical fruits are overridden by a light citrus rind grapefruit bitterness  f this has a medium body with a mediumlight carbonatin the mouthfeel is soft and creamy with a nice dry finish  o this was the beer that made me a legend at my familys thanksgiving celebration i believe it was 2012 or 2013 and i had brought 3 growlers of this and it was a instant hit i dont think i actually got to drink any myself but luckily for me i had a four pack of gandhi stashed in my car trunk cooler this is such a great beer and at 62 abv it really packs in the flavor it has excellent shelf life a fuzzy at 2 to 3 months is not much different than a fuzzy fresh off the canning line batch variation is minimal and even the less than stellar batches are still better than most beers out there this is probably one of the best showcases of citra i have ever had highly recommended,0.5672678805764761,0.9915
1326,Cable Car,at last i got to try this one the hallmark of this one is the complexity there are layers upon layers of sour fruit wood mineral earthiness dank funk and acidic fruits the smell is a fruity horse blanket with plenty of musk and funk to go around carbonation is a little high but otherwise wonderful in the feel until the very acidic finish bring the tums a well made beer that stands the test of time,0.5672203438841235,0.8271
4572,Abraxas,pours deep black as expected nose is malty and cinnamon a lot of cinnamon taste with dark chocolate notes some alcohol on the finish i dont notice much from the peppers in aroma or taste the beer has a great mouthfeel really nice overall i was glad to finally get a chance to try this it is a good beer but with some many great stouts available at lower price points i dont know that id revisit this,0.5672134379065026,0.8978
5681,Hop JuJu,thanks to pinz412 for this one from a box in nbs bif 13 16oz can dated 21121 poured into 14oz teku poured a clean clear bright copper color with an inch of white head that had good retention and very light lacing  bright citrusy hops topped caramel malts in the nose  very similar on the tongue with a very nice bitterness to keep the tastebuds awake  the body was mediumfull a bit coarse across the palate and had a dry finish  drinkability was good easy to see this being in rotation if it were local  overall a very nice brew certainly worth your time if you see it,0.5671889438521585,0.9813
1593,Nectarine Premiere,togo can getting to finally try a degarde for the 2nd time the color looks stone fruit peach oranges the smell is very distinct of sourness vinegary slight fruit notes overall i was hoping for that special first sip that takes my breath away but a bit disappointment bit nevertheless its good cheers,0.567182404936693,0.743
3735,Double Stack,pours really nice with a relatively thick tan head smells wonderful tons of maple followed by roasty coffee taste is underwhelming compared to the smell neither the maple nor the coffee is as strong as you would expect from the nose and the base beer is not tasty enough to back them up some bitterness comes through but its almost burnttasting not sure if thats from the malts or the coffee feel is not great not really very thick for an 11 stout and its a little overcarbed too overall a fairly good beer but disappointing i would probably like it a lot more if i hadnt tasted other farsuperior coffeemaple stouts like islbs and imperial falling colors,0.5671052215346404,0.528
1743,Ephraim,on tap at three penny in montpelier  delicious and robust offering from hill farmstead that reflects their older school approach to an neipa  big citrus and pine notes that fly off the palate with only a light astringent bitterness on the tail end  90100,0.5670665600745857,0.5267
3133,Framboos,201718 bottle  pours a deep lush red with very little foam  smell is robustly tart with big washings of ripe raspberries blackberries and some lemon  taste well the taste is just wow this hits the tongue with a brash and potent sourness and acidity really opening the nostrils and gets the salivating going you can really feel the acidity in the jaw and your tastebuds just beg for an encore sip number two presents the framboos with a huge pop of raspberries and blackberries hints of vinegar but stays just on the right side of the line by now im practically drooling and having to restrain myself from just chugging the remainder of this 45 dollar bottle every sip just opens up the complexity and notes of funk hay lemon and grass come through but the stars of the show are the raspberries juicy and summery and just the right ripeness this is a stunning stunning beer  mouthfeel is thin and sparkly almost champagney  overall this is the best raspberry beer ive ever had even surpassing rose de gambrinus which ranks in my all time top five this is as good as sours get,0.5670640122394505,0.9732
297,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),cbs is dark brown essentially black shiny completely opaque and viscous huge khaki colored head forms with an aggressive pour once formed the head slowly begins to collapse until a thin layer of foam remains on top of the beer lots of tan lacing remains on the glass  cbs has notes of coffee roasted malts a touch of pine with notes of oak bourbon smoke and a sweet tantalizing hint of maple coming through balanced is what comes mind to describe this aroma  cbs has some nice roasted malts up front bourbon oak a touch of pine and lots of coffee come through up front at some point the palate suddenly picks up this subtle but noticeable sweet maple note the bourbon comes through on the back end with some heat again the coffee the maple the base stout and the barrel aging is all present all noticeable but no one component dominates the flavor profile  cbs is medium to full bodied really smooth with moderate carbonation somewhat drier on the finish  cbs is a beer that is remarkably good but i think that these days it does not get the credit or accolades that it once did in large part due to what i think its is greatest virtue  balance its got barrel aging coffee maple but it lets each component shine without outshining any of the others,0.5670458161808271,0.959
1599,Nectarine Premiere,poured out as a slightly hazed orange color with a thin white head on top the smell of the beer is packed with funky nectarine sourness which is to be expected from de garde the flavors are similar to the nosem lots of acidic funky nectarine coming in full speed from start to finish the feel is light to medium bodied and dry overall its a kick ass sour so its worthy seeking out if youre into that sort of thing,0.5669675576305937,-0.0828
2542,Beyond Good And Evil,finally trying this one march 28 2021 bottled 10318 for me the feel is just outstanding full and creamy and smooth approaching syrupy but still with enough carbonation to keep it drinkable its hill farmstead of course the feel is going to be exceptional the aroma is strangely mild but the flavor explodes with maple syrup and whiskey notes and has to be the sweetest of any hf beer i can recall just lean enough to stay in balance very nice drinking,0.566821931031023,0.5913
1060,Doubleganger,wow just wow i figure this has to be one of the first new england ipas judging by the entry date canned 127 so cloudy i cannot see through it very similar in appearance to orange juice fluffy head that dissipates but leaves thick long lasting lacing citrusy and dank hop scents that punched me in the nose and i liked it taste is a battle of titanshuge citrusy flavors duke it out with dank bitterness and its a fight worth being in the middle of big bodied mouth watering subtle booziness mouth filling extremely sippable first of the long time wants from the box of tree house i got this week and i am not disappointed in the slightest damn great beer,0.5668153670096492,0.7123

2654,Society & Solitude #5,one of the prettiest beers i have seen in a while this pours a hazy orange juice color with a nice two fingers of head head lasts a while before breaking leaving generous lacing  smell is really quite tropical and fruity im getting a sweet citrus and melon dominance with a touch of a pith or pine in there too  taste is a followthrough of the nose with the sweet juicy tropicals coming through strong it seems kind of a hoppy fruit juice bitterness of pith and pine on the back end  feel is creamy and smooth as all get out carbonation is spot on and the finish brings a dry earthy bitterness that lasts and lasts  i am going to say that i am lucky to have had this beer and to be honest its a couple of months old and still fantastic i know if i had regular access to this id have a fridge full,0.5666296402326578,0.9756
5947,Peche 'n Brett,fresh batch couldnt read date but was just distroed  pours a pale straw with haze strong brett on the nose with faint stonefruit but peach is lost in the background brett is dominant not much else makes it through except alcohol heat on the finish light spritz with good carb body hides its abv well  overall a nice beer but not worth the 27 a bottle,0.5666024294942986,0.8834
957,Ann,finally after a few years and some adventuresome and muddy miles she landed soft golden hue fluffy juicy head gently wine oak barrel and microflora tones both on the nose and taste and silky smooth definately matches up with the hype it was her it was she it was fabulous,0.5666023989978431,0.8442
996,Chemtrailmix,draft at dld and on draft 2 days later at fff  dark dark dark appearance no foamhead except for caramel colored ring on the edge of glass cinnamon bourbon some chocolate and even a slight bit of jamminess taste follows the nose good bit of cinnamon but not overpowering other ingredients chocolate is present and some jam quality too good bourbon note and a very sticky thick mouthfeel  as someone whos had the past four marshmallow handjees and many other dl variants this just may be the best one chemtrailmix 2018 also this dwarfs ba abraxas 17 i had and makes the ba abraxas taste one dimensional and lacking in barrel presence top 5 beers ive had all time easily,0.5664283426548217,0.946
5549,Birth Of Tragedy,drinks like a stout dark roast flavors and a really nice vanilla and bourbon added from the barrel complex as a porter can be dont expect a huge ba stout it is a porter after all but if you want a well made example of an imperial with stout like characteristics this is the one,0.5663723961645694,0.8864
5545,Birth Of Tragedy,most recent batch didnt note the date drank on 342017  lnot overly thick deep dark brownish black tan head  stboom just fantastic combination of heavy oak bourbon and milk chocolate with some additional sweetness coming through from the honey and a hint of vanilla too and the coffee is subdued boy this is glorious  fdrinkable for sure no booze  overallthe smell and taste explain it all glad i have another one of these as this was just fantastic definitely underrated and i will seek out more of this,0.5662338622163898,0.9657
4826,Matt,2016 vintage poured a fully opaque dark brown color with just the very fewest bubbles an aggressive pour could achieve no head thus no retention or lacing lots of sludge left in the bottom the bottle as well  lots of dark fruit and malt scents in the nose reminds me of a belgian quad  very similar on the tongue with some noticeable alcohol heat  the body was smooth even and had a sweet finish but the lack of carbonation was an issue  drinkability was ok but some carb would have made it greattoexcellent  overall another great beer from hotd but please yall put some bubbles in,0.5662283519324245,0.8591
5515,Juicy,375 ml bottle from december 2016 decanted carefully in case of sediment juicy pours an orangecopper with a thin layer of head from bubbles that rise up in a curiously slow way as if the liquid is more viscous than it otherwise seems beautiful aromas of white wine apple cider vinegar papaya honeydew melon and orange blossom the perfect amount of bright acidity on the tongue enough to get the salivary glands pumping but not so much as to overwhelm the delicate complexity of flavors on parade here im loving the influence of the wine barrels,0.5661792308947852,0.891

5079,Temptation,bottle date 5616 palate contaminants other beer  look is a clear light gold with a moderate amount of fine white head  smell is a bit brett a bit floral a bit cilantro and a bit plum blossom its an interesting combination the word fresh comes to mind it says chardonnay on the label but i cant pick out anything specific to that wine from the future yet  the taste definitely shows shades of the chardonnay grape that wine is usually along a spectrum of mineral to butter for me and i can pick out both characteristics but overall its leans toward butter or malolactic for yinz who talk big like that the wine flavors dominate like with almanacs grand cru theres also a lot of apple taste accompanied by earthy grape leaves and floral floral floral shock of all shocks im enjoying sipping on this one  the feel is thinmoderate for the type and the carbonation is a bit coarse still the aftertaste is pleasant with the butter and apple although those two dont fuse,0.5661095437213159,0.965
1620,Focal Banger,pint can of focal banger served as is my preference in a pint glass appears to be dated 040121 pours thick murky yellow and forms a nice thick head aroma is a bit yeasty fruity aroma is not too potent to my nose but theres some lemon and passionfruit juice flavor is a completely different level with pineapple and tropical punch blasting through a bitter hoppy backdrop which is unmistakably an ipa where this beer really excels is that it is both a juicy ne ipa and an american ipa at the same time compromising on neither  im tasting this side by side with the more famous heady topper which i recall not liking quite as much when i first tasted them side by side in i believe 2017 heady is a bit clearer in my glass and it might have a slightly better hop aroma but the combination of flavors and balance of focal banger is just so much more impressive to my palate that it will always be the better beer in my opinion and at 7 vs 8 the difference between single and double seems pretty dubious to me  though for sure heady topper tastes more like a double  id love to taste this side by side against the best ne ipas ive had from pnw breweries including gigantic hopworks totally chill reubens hazealicious and breakside,0.5660939885700123,0.9885
4396,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,for goodness sake let this warm up to near room temperature otherwise its a dull muted brandy barrelled beer around 6065 degrees f it emerges into a chocolate fondue apple of a stout still of only modest complexity but definitely bolder and more appealing,0.5660412636034359,0.8132

2860,Samuel Adams Utopias,first time seeing it available around here so had to pony up the money for a tiny 1 oz taste the smell was literally filling the area around the bottle nose started like four feet away caramel notes cologne color is rich clear rusty amber first sip is boozy reminds me of cognac with a solid pitted fruit on the front caramelly vanilla in back it looks thin but its actually very viscous and leaves some heavy legs mouthfeel is medium with a crisp cleansing bite from the alcohol it really is not like what one would think of as a traditional strong ale but more a spirit  liquor one ounce leaves one wanting more but it was a real treat,0.5659495309073029,0.911
3818,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,september 3rd 2015  when i leave san diego this will probably be the most memorable beer of the many many beers i had for one i had it at one of my first visits to any brewery since moving to san diego but it is also an amazing brew to the eye it looks like a somewhat intense stout with a brown foam and a thick body but not too oily the aroma is big and bold and cold and saturnine like the smell of cold metal but with some cacao nibs on the edge the flavor is the real appeal here creamy rich but not cloying it is decadent and deserving huge gushing chocolate notes combine with deluxe and topshelf coffee notes like bird rock coffee better yet this beer gets spicier as it warms like a christmas ale and reveals shades of nutmeg and cinnamon could this be a rare 10 for flavor,0.5659301537786562,0.9895

1370,Aaron,a near perfect example of an english barleywine this one aged two years in bourbon barrels and also bottle conditioned its the saisons and wild beers that get all the attention from these guys but this is as good as anything else in the game in this style and seems gentler more subtle and more mature and drinkable than other over the top barrel heavy offerings with lots of residual sugar firestone walker comes to mind there this is just a wonderful cold weather sipper and honestly the essence of the style as far as i am concerned big thanks to my buddy for sharing this one among many others in an epic session over the weekend i have been wanting to try this forever this has a deep matte mahogany color to it a tall tan head creamy and thick and no visible sediment at all looks well cleaned up and mature the aroma is rich barley malt some sweet long boiled and toffee character to it chestnut maple and toasted bread its immediately not that sweet full of earthiness and enormously layered the bourbon has some vanilla and honey notes going on but doesnt interfere with the base beer it enhances sweet oak in the mix as well raisin and fig the flavor is amazing really about the barley malt very enlgish to me no hops at all maybe some maris otter in here with some darker crystal definitely a concentrated richness to it without decadent sweetness weighing it down and the booziness is minimal for the style although this is a bit lower anyway i like it not being a focal point in the taste the bourbon and oak are smooth and not too forward and there is a wonderful depth and body to this better and better as it warms too the perfect balance of all the elements here some yeast character through most of it and a curiously clean finish for the style near perfection here no frills barleywine as it should be a wonderful drinking experience,0.5655501744450941,0.9983
5607,Space Trace,this beer is throwing me for a loop second time i am trying space trace but first time writing a review and it tastes more like fo than a chocolate coconut beer pours thick and dark with a good amount of carbonation for the style leaves a layer of foam covering the surface of the beer you get an overwhelming vanilla note on the nose a little bit of chocolate on the back end and a generally sweet character coconut doesnt really stand out however the taste is sweet and balanced and follows the nose with chocolate becoming more prevalent as it warms a touch too carbonated for the style but not overtly so another hit from bottle logic nice barrel sweet balanced and utterly delicious,0.5655412726505434,0.9866
3858,Medianoche - Coconut,review is based on the bottle release which has been the best of the 3 coconut releases thus far pitch black pour recedes to a small mocha head no lacing smell is coconut lather  not sweet nor perfumeladen but very aggressive taste follows with rich coconut and vanilla flavors throughout barrel is a bit subdued its whiskey forward at first but quickly mellows and lacks that oak or charred wood complexity on the finish alcohol presence is minimal but that 145 will hit you before you finish mouthfeel is slick each sip quickly subsides leaving a coconutmeetsbrownsugar residue reminiscent of a cookie or granola bar all in all its a great beer and real treat i could drink an entire bottle but for my palate its best split that said its far from my favorite variant smores and coffee maple are clearly ahead of this one for me and i probably wont actively seek out more,0.5655141178841641,0.9797
2636,Last Buffalo In The Park,the beer was black with a small beige head strong aroma of alcohol with coconut chocolate and vanilla the taste followed the nose precisely i was a little taken aback at first the alcohol was almost overwhelming after sitting for a while however the beer became quite enjoyable unquestionably a dessert beer,0.5655064852173874,0.7574
1951,Triple Sunshine,12oz can from the source pours a clean burnt orange color with a half inch of clowdy white head in a lawsons glass nice floral hop aromas hit the nose  very smooth with almost no aftertaste some pineapple on the tip of the tongue perfectly balanced with the alcohol burn very well hidden worldclass is a correct description,0.5654136227327,0.8803
4137,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,l golden yellow color s very funky t soft and strong start to a chaotic and harsh finish f sharp and distinct o not a bad geuze but not as great as the honey blend,0.565250635054615,-0.5807
2340,Breakfast Stout,i have wanted to one of these for the longest time knew there was a winter storm coming and picked up a six just spent 3 hours shoveling 18 inches of snow deep coffee brown on the pour with a beige head and thick lace aroma is heavenly  rich coffee roasted oats malts and chocolate taste follows the aroma and each sip presents sweet and malty bitter notes feel is creamy and fullbodied abv is 83 but doesnt come on strong this is one is worldclass and more than lives up to its reputation,0.5652501711835635,0.0892
106,Heady Topper,pint can of headytopper dated 060521 served in a can glass because i want to pours slightly hazy and with a nice white head though not quite as cloudy or murky as focal banger aroma is not the most potent but it has a more traditional pine hop profile than i expected inhaling deeply i do get a bit of sweet juice flavor is big on those tropical juicy flavors guava mango grapefruit zest where focal banger has considerable ibus and conventional alpha bitterness heady topper has the strength and even a hint of the 8 abv is actually present on the palate but this is really only a comparative defect compared to millions of other ipas the alcohol is still very well hidden  tasting this side by side with focal banger i appreciate the differences but confirm my initial impression from 4 years ago in burlington  i prefer fb both have an excellent mouthfeel with very fine carbonation which by itself might be remarkable for an american ipa in a can but this beer is quite literally heady  and im not one to shy away from heavy beers in the 812 range or even higher but the balance and flavors in focal banger are just better in my opinion even better than this unarguably great beer  potentially this is heady toppers 15000th review,0.5652404728383363,0.9911

715,KBS,surprisingly dry and nonheady for a 12 beer the very present bourbon hit on the smell was pleasantly tamed in taste oh my my my thisis a mouthful roasted malts and coffee but in a semisweet germanswiss chocolate bar the burnt and bourbon flavors match perfectly i waited until 59 degrees and got a 34 head i appreciate the lack of simple sugars giving this a dryer taste than one would expect alcohol is actually well hidden here in my opinion in taste though it is very present in the nose from the bourbon big difference big body curvacious and complex to the 9th do this,0.5644064047223439,0.9413
1878,Haze,for an ipa the smell and taste cannot get any better a lot of treehouse beers fade into memory as tasting a lot alike great stuff but not individually memorable however haze is such a unique standout the ability to make hops taste both of peach and hops is amazing by far my favorite treehouse beer,0.5644037299297394,0.9325

1032,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,l pours a brownblack with a perfect deep mahogany head which does not dissipate too quickly  a slight oak and cocoa overpowered by cinnamon and a spiciness  t fudgy up front followed by a perfect spicy chocolateness and really a great mole character which i what i think is their goal almost taste like a cinnamon graham cracker in the beginning  m slightly thin for a beer of this stature but the medium body is welcome with the spice complexity  o finally glad i got to enjoy this one ive been seeking for years its a well crafted beer and one of the best spiced beers ive had,0.5642112068529843,0.9845
6165,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,well executed combination of maple and bourbon barrels both are very prominently displayed without overpowering the other  maple is a more subtlenatural component and not an overlysweet artificial flavor  really easy to drink with medium body,0.564209143704884,0.6478
4820,Matt,this one pours a very dead looking and murky purplish brown with no head and no lacing  this smells very much like apple brandy with boozy fruit caramel and more booze  this is absolutely hindered by the complete and total lack of carbonation i guess im not sophisticated enough to appreciate something like that its got some interesting flavors like smoke prunes chocolate tobacco and tons of apple brandy its super flabby however and just feels unfinished i cant get fully behind it it feels so thin and flat  the mouthfeel is obviously a weak point here even just a little bit of carbonation would be so helpful  this is very intriguing but i just simply didnt enjoy it,0.5641870558559945,-0.3181

354,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,bottle brought by fux to the moeder lambic tasting a few weeks ago great time gents thanks heaps for sharing this one man  from a 750 into a tasting glass vintage 2010 drunk next to a 2010 base beer  appearance a thick dense black pour produces a smaller looser looking dark mocha colored head that immediately disappears fades to a slight ring jet black body with no carbonation at all a slight ring remains but leaves no lacing down the glass thick black tar for sure but the head is a little lack luster at this point  smell some brandy here with touches of vanilla and oak notes of cinnamon chilies and light vanilla as well though the adjuncts have definitely faded the brandy barrel is a little mute as well meaning this is a little less impressive than the regular 2010 as well as the other barreled variants ive sampled  taste even less adjunct than the nose had showcased some mild brandy oak and vanilla up front with some chilies and cinnamon at the swallow as well things are there but not very convincingly flavor comes out more after the swallow with a lingering finish of brandy some vanilla milk chocolate chilies and spicy cinnamon touches of roasted malt make an appearance as well nice but the barrel is rather mellow at this point and adjuncts are perhaps not as forthcoming as they once were still very tasty but not bold enough to be really impressive  palate good feel here just like the 2010 base beer mediumfull body oily with medium carbonation creamy on the palate goes down fine with a slightly oily and mouthcoating finish solid stuff  overall really happy to have tried this one though i will say that it has probably seen better days i never had the chance to have it fresh but at this point the barrel is rather mellow and the adjuncts are not as forthcoming as the regular 2010 base beer right now this is still tasty and enjoyable but probably not as impressive as it once was if you have one its probably time to do something with it as more time will not be kind thanks again fux this was a lot of fun,0.5639424087229138,0.992
6194,The Streets,you can smell it from a foot away not quite a facsimile for orange juice but pretty close this is a frankenstein hop amalgam surprised it has such complexity  a lesser malt base would turn this to a muddled mess i get lots of different fruits  orange and lime zest give some tang while stone fruits give a nice contrasting unctiousness it finishes as dry as it can and the body is surprisingly spry for a big beer well done trillium,0.5639174368461723,0.9109
372,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,this fine beer was on tap at cigar city on july 9th through july 11th i took down notes at that time but its so hard to forget a beer this good the brewery served this beer to me in a cigar city snifter  this beer was thick and black that the beer coming out of the tap looked like the tap was pouring used motor oil out of an old car luckily there isnt a mechanic next door so i knew this beer instead of oil no highlights in this beer whatsoever not any light source that can be found on this world would have the power to shine through this beer i could have taken the beer outside of the tasting room and held it up into the bright tampa sun and not one streak of light would penetrate this beer surprisingly there was a nice head of foam on this beer the initial head of foam was about 14 of an inch in height and dark mocha in color it had good renetion that left behind a few spots around the edge of the beer and some tiny blots of lace around the glass  the aroma was just as thick as the appearance up front it was super sweet with the rich scent of caramel vanilla molasses and candy sugar it was so sweet that i thought i was going to get a cavity just smelling this beer after the sweets had enough in comes some roasted malt a sprinkle of roasted coffee a drop of dark chocolate a whiff of oak and a touch of apple brandy at the finish line i liked how there was plenty of aromas to keep my nose busy but i especially liked how every aroma had their equal time in the spotlight  as you could probably tell already the taste was just as thick as the appearance and the aroma the taste was sweet but it wasnt as sweet as the aroma the taste was thick with caramel molasses a drop of dark chocolate vanilla dark roasted malt a gentle touch of roasted coffee beans a little oak a taste that combined apple brandy and caramel and then this beer finishes up with an expected gentle splash of chili pepper i knew this beer is brewed with some chili but i really wasnt expecting the chili to show up at all great surprise  for a high abv thick barrel aged imperial stout this beer masks its high abv there was so much going on in this beer that my body couldnt pick up on the high abv the aftertaste was just as thick as everything else the aftertaste was filled with roasted malt roasted coffee beans oak caramel molasses and more of that gentle chili pepper  theres no doubt about it this is truly one of the greatest beers in the world if you ever see this beer on tap at cigar city consider yourself lucky and get about 2 glasses of it,0.5638744327394084,0.9983
3452,Hypermash Hydra,the viscous used motor oil pour of black with dark brown ribbons builds a dark mocha blanket that audibly fizzles out quickly  taste is intense of coconut as if it were just very recently freshly toasted and to absolute unbelievable perfection its the most spot on expression of toasted coconut in a beer i think ive ever had and this is right off the jump it doesnt get floral or astringent or too sticky sweet either  theres a little bit of a cinnamon bark and bourbon barrel kick to the nose while on the palate the coffee is the stronger contributor enhancing the chocolatey malt by creating a divine mocha waffle cone character its a full on dessert assault vehicle  the feel of the body isnt quite so viscous as it looks but its substantially thicker than any other bottle logic stout ive had however because of its thickness the barrel doesnt seem to come through as much in flavor it finishes semisticky with a little bit of heat butthe bottom half of the bottlegot dam it becomes even thicker and also more coconuty and chocolatey and just absurdly luscious i guess i forgot to shake well,0.563866494057926,0.8338

332,Pliny The Elder,a generous share from erland pours out to a slightly hazy pale straw yellow forming a rocky white head with very good retention and lacing carbonation is moderate the nose is mostly pine and then some grapefruit a little bit of cat pee mouthfeel is prickly and lighter bodied than given the abv so i suspect white sugar is added here to thin this out flavor again is pine and grapefruit not overly complex with a firm bitterness and a dry finish  15 years ago when there wasnt an absolute deluge of ipas dipas on the market i could see why this gained some notoriety in todays market it pales to the abundance of choices growing up in michigan where two hearted is the norm the same thing has happened here still a great beer but in the broader context middling at best this is a good thing though,0.5637050711338193,0.9465

5342,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,crazy though i may be i actually prefer the nonbarrelaged bottle of imperial german chocolate cupcake stout over the barrelaged bottle  this bottle though not barrelaged is plenty rich and sweet enough  the chocolate to the nose and taste is thick and very pleasant without any tangible heat from the abv its quite pleasant without being too much in any particular regard though it is tremendously sweet i actually turned down pours of several other beers after drinking this one my palate and my teeth just needed a break so much sugar  the angry chair reputation is welldeserved theyre crafting some particularly devious diabetes beers down there,0.5636158250459649,0.9198

4821,Matt,hardly zero head or carbonation in a 2013 taste was bourbon soaked raisans sweet but quite pleasant it didnt look great and it was prob a little thin for the abv and the barrel but defintely respect the old ale style and would not turn it down again,0.5633059071888011,0.7649
2579,The Rusty Nail,2018 vintage  appearance pitch black with almost no head but whats there is dark khaki  aroma the cinnamon comes through surprisingly given the year other more typical notes arise such as dark malt and some barrel  flavor cinnamon licorice and chocolate all come through in a harmonious way so awesome that the adjuncts havent faded best of all is that the cinnamon is not overpowering its just there to be noticed theres a strong bourbon presence that tapers all of it off and lingers around i get some dark cherry as well or maybe a sweet vermouth flavor in the background definitely a smores type thing overall  palatefinish great thickness  oily viscous but fluffy finishes with cinnamon licorice and barrel  overall awesome beer honestly it doesnt completely blow my socks off like i thought it would but its damn close wonderfully balanced great mouth feel and great flavors coming through if i werent spoiled by the adjunctheavy barrel aged stout train i could see this being one of my tops,0.5632958286568015,0.9966

810,Blessed,drank a bottle of this recently thick and viscous used motor oil pour that smelled of coconut vanilla and marshmallow huge aroma on this taste was good with tons of coconut and vanilla but i also found it to be cloying very sweet which really took away from the beer feel was great nice and viscous mouth coating this beer hit some of the marks for me but really was just too sweet in the flavor department wish it were toned down a touch,0.5629776800803231,0.9775
3551,Fundamental Forces,this one pours a very dark black color with a small head and not much lacing  this one smells like oxidization and cardboard artificial vanilla candy syrup booze and chocolate  i expected quite a bit more out of this beer given the 16 abv i expected that it wouldnt be over the hill but it certainly is unfortunately its oxidized with old fruit and stale flavors theres also a definitely artificial sweetness here unlike most version of fo  they almost always have legitimate vanilla flavors i am very disappointed here  this is medium bodied and pretty creamy with a heavy duty boozines on the very back end of each sip  this was honestly supposed to be really great and it was instead massively disappointing something these things happen,0.562926242795351,0.9442
4466,Leaner,enjoyed out of a brown 750 ml bottle with a sticker denoting it as being bottled on 9132016 consumed as part of a small bottle share on 422 poured into a teku style glass  appearance 425  pours a vibrant yellow with just the slightest twinge of orange giving it a depth of color not really terribly hazy but its also not completely translucent eitherlikely from the fact that we had no lambic basket handy to keep the yeast confined to the bottom of the bottle the dregs looked like straight juice not much of a headjust a little bit and pretty much no lacing to speak of  smell 45  wonderful aroma of freshcut ripe peach flesh is accentuated by underlying acidity and brightness from the wild bacteria honestly theres not much to write about the aroma because its so simple and straightforward the peach flavor is front and center even though its been seven months since bottling  taste 45  the flavor very much follows from the smell here with the juicy flavor of fresh peach leading the way providing support is a nice lemony citric tartness that is enough to counterbalance the sweetness of the stone fruit hiding in the background is a bit more complexity with shades of funkiness and a woody mustiness  mouthfeel 425  light bodied and moderate to light carbonation finish has just enough pucker to give your cheeks that little pinch of sour  overall 45 a fantastic beer and one of the most true to the flavor of peach that i can recall having tried i suppose i shouldnt be that surprised when two of the heavyweights of brewing sour beers with fruit put their heads together on a recipe would be really curious to try the side project version,0.5628884196755675,0.9937

4781,Leche Borracho,purchased for 20 from a private collector 3 year old 500 ml bottle from 2018 poured into a snifter this is my first bottle logic brew as im in ohio so its difficult to get california beer out here poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle then disappeared completely the strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon even though theres also tequila barrels at work also notes of vanilla chocolate and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers the scent is very strong and peppery and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly truly a delicious smell very complex and tantalizing there is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip its very thirst quenching after getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla cinnamon washes through my mouth followed by the tequila and bourbon its funny but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently and i didnt think i would be able to also a bit smoky the pepper comes last stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy with a nice douse of effervescence overall the smell knocked my socks off and the taste was very complex and layered although i wouldnt say this is one of my favorite beers its definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing to allow all the various flavors to come out so its getting my top marks for being unique an important quality i seek in beer,0.5627653924367119,0.9929

4814,Matt,bottle 2019 release these still hotd offerings have trouble looking overly enticing through no fault of their own a darker than medium brown it appears somewhat opaque as stated no head so no lacing  nose has the aromas of a dry after dinner wine without the acidity the base earthy wooden notes gets a little accent of fig and date theres a bit of smoke as well but more like what would be in the air after a nights rain dampened the previous evenings bonfire  taste also starts with a slightly tannic dry wine but the fig comes it quickly to turn this towards its true beer nature a little sweetness comes next followed by a growing smoke and a brief interlude of a bold red wine and leather the smoke comes in as if the dark fruits spent a little time in the smoker  the ending is moderately dry with a little bit of stickiness allowing the last flavors to linger into the aftertaste the lack of carbonation is almost not missed though i think id rather have this still than with even moderate carbonation  a true treat where the smoke gets integrated so well into the flavors of the beer to lift it from really good to great,0.5626044532066997,0.989

15,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,2020 on draft at toppling goliath  it pours pitch black with minimalalmostnone foam around the ring of the glass aroma has loads of maple with coffee like maple syrup covered pancake stack they are definitely present in flavor maybe more maple than coffee along with chocolate and a bit of roast all laying on top of that bourbon sweet base the most impressive thing is the feel here it has that soft warm feel theres no hint of booze yet its also somehow thick and the flavors hang around for a while its really one of the best mouthfeel beers ive had for imperial stout  are there beers that have perhaps better flavor or aroma yeah i think so but the feel is at the very top great beer,0.5623359856278288,0.9655
681,Very GGGreennn,canned a week ago tried alongside an equally old can of juice machine  l  deep amberorange haze in the glass with 2 fingers of sudsy white head produced with moderately aerated pour lovely retention and lacing looks about as perfect as green and vg s  even compared to juice machine this is super aromatic pineapple mango passionfruit yellow peach nectarine papaya dank fusel notes unripe melon the whole nine yards t  like with vg this is a little more balanced in terms of juiciness vs bitterness than many of the other tree house heavy hitters you know youre drinking beer which is nice while at the same time getting a real onslaught of hopderived tropical goodness its different than the pureeforward juice machine but not necessarily better or worse f  soft pillowy creamy the usual th descriptors o  might be the pinnacle of the tree house lineup for me price and availability knock it down just a hair but this is an excellent dipa  96100,0.5622918754535173,0.8312
572,Abner,l beautiful deep cloudy orange with 1 inch of frothy white head poured into a tulip glass from a growler filled hf the day before  s tropical fruit but very ripe tropical fruit i smell guava and passionfruit and mango in there very crisp aroma  t a very hoppy and hazy dipa mouthwateringly good lots of the same flavor notes in the aroma translate to the taste  mango ripe navel orange towards the end a bit of a citrus rind and some pine just fantastic though  really well balanced and just so clean for a beer of 8  f moderate amount of carbonation extremely luscious definitely made me salivate  o this is a really fantastic double from hf it is one of their most common beers and although i have tried a whole variety of their offerings over the years have never had this one this is just spectacular  likely my favorite pale ale from them and is just a step above all of the other doubles in the vt area at the moment in my opinion at least the aroma of this is very very pleasant and you can go through several glasses without skipping a beat if you see it get it,0.5621752009183719,0.9916
2864,Samuel Adams Utopias,the odd beer that smells better than it tastes no issue as both are excellent medium dark color nice head dont overdo this one drinks more like a liquor than a beer,0.5621745118320263,0.8268
333,Pliny The Elder,rich copper color and unctuous mouthfeel malty and hoppy this is a very wellmade beer but as with so many pioneers in so many fields the rest of the field eventually caught up and this isnt as remarkable as it once was,0.5620834881792093,-0.379
2318,Breakfast Stout,founders breakfast stout is an amazing beer that luckily can be found widely  poured from a bottle in a 4 pack into a traditional pint glass the stout pours deep black with a slight umber cast around the margins a head barely forms before disappearing to the edges creating a ring of light cream that lasted until around half way through the drink the edge thins to create a dark umber ring as i tip the glass back for a drink  the stout smells mainly of coffee and dark chocolate with slight hints of caramel and malt the taste is supremely balanced which is why this beer is highly rated immediately the coffee and chocolate hit on the front i was anticipating a bitter or alcohol taste due to the higher than average alcohol content when the flavor moved back but that never happened the coffee roast and chocolate continued all the way through and left a slightly spiced aftertaste  the stout feels medium thickness but not creamy due to its low carbonation swooshing the the beer in my mouth it does have a creamier feel as the little amount of carbonation in the beer comes out  overall this beer is packed with flavor and has nearly no negatives as long as one enjoys coffee and chocolate the only thing that could potentially be better is a creamy head but that may mess up the balance founders has struck with this gem,0.5619363547201426,0.81
4437,Hold On To Sunshine,i like it as a pb stoutdefinitely one of the better tasting substyle of milksweet stout as a milksweet stout it does a good job as well its hard not to just cp my review of gunners daughter here because i think the two beers are that similar except for a couple alcohol percentage points and slightly thicker feel from hots  a dark wood burnt walnutcharcoal moderatedeep khaki foamline head very fizzy for a stout with lactose  s earth peanut shells black dirt fruity coffee english toffee  m sweet and sticky with a slight drying edge  t like eating a full reeses cup after taking a shot of espresso which i just did for comparison purposes overall the chocolate is more enduring than chocolate red berry chocolate fruitiness counterbalances the earthy peanut dryness of the short espresso  o its a good beer but ranks behind pretty much every other stout ive had from th its one of those beers that if i had access to routinely nbd but not necessarily worth a repeat trip especially since gunners daughter is such a good comp minus some sticky mouthfeel,0.5619306872817299,0.9648
5691,Hop JuJu,tried in the taproom a few months back really strong hip and citrus flavors but nicely balanced and a great finish probably the best ipa ive ever had up there with some seattle ipas,0.5618988178598305,0.9617
2877,Pirate Bomb!,really really good super thick coating mouthfeel with tons of chocolate coffee and a little bit of the chili pepper coming in on the finish the rum barrel was a great idea for this beer the barrel is very pronounced and compliments the base beer really well this was a great idea for this beer i like it better than regular bomb,0.5618236651269839,0.9741

382,Assassin,2019 vintage poured on dec 19 2020  pours a viscous used motor oil color with a mocha color head that leaves minimal lacing  nose is of dark fruit vanilla leather dark chocolate and faint oak this is culmination of great barrel and base beer  taste follows nose with subtle dark fruit dark chocolate lingering vanilla and barrel character the taste once again really showcases the great use of barrels and base stout  feel is where this beer falls short it is slightly over carbed that thins out the beer more than desired on the pallet however beer is still medium body as this sits for 45 mins the carb starts to dissipates and leaves a more velvet mouth feel  overall excellently crafted barrel aged stout that showcases the use of great barrels and stout recipe unbelievable that this is non adjucted i think the beer falls short on feelbut gets better once it sits open but i would gladly drink another i also do not think it is worth the price of admission unless you are able to get it directly from the brewery,0.5617608439072276,0.9576
2949,Coconut Vibes,750ml bottle batch 2 supposedly 4x the coconut addition of the first batch it shows it has way too much coconut in it which doesnt mesh very well with the big chocolate fudge of the base beer it is too intense on both counts which normally is not a bad thing but they just dont really balance well with each other its too sweet and weirdly cloying full bodied creamy thick and viscous but the coconut and the imperial stout just didnt work i think it just needed the barrel aging to really smooth it out and add something to break up the weird duopoly of sweet coconut and sweet chocolate malt,0.5616928259919332,0.8493
167,Mornin' Delight,2019 vintage  appearance is standard imperial stout dark brownblack body tan head that doesnt dissipate right away thick sticks to the glass  smells like maple and chocolate theres coffee in there somewhere but the maple overpowers the nose  taste follows nose but with coffee sweet maple mostly coffee as well but not as prominent  bodyfeel is fantastic sticks around well after swallowing  overall id never turn this beer down it isnt something to drink everyday but its a delicious treat for every now and again,0.5616399116441013,0.9734

622,Bourbon County Brand Stout,2020 version i took this out of the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for thirty minutes before pouring  l black looks like coffee head disappears almost instantly s oak vanilla caramel t dark chocolate at initial sip coffee notes of bourbon with a lingering sweetness f rich decadent coats the tongue leaves a stickiness on the lips slight carbonation o this stuff is incredible i highly recommend it the smell complements the taste extremely well as i have found with most stouts needs to be enjoyed at 50 degrees or warmer the taste continues to improve as it warms i imagine this would go excellent with a cigar,0.5613600621330236,0.9809

4297,DFPF,now this is what i am talking about this is how you use tropical fruit in a sour beer splendid stuff gives me a new respect for the brewery and despite how the hype train rolls i would drink this over their highly acclaimed maimi madness any day brilliant fuschia pink color not a ton of head but electric like some of the intense hibiscus beers out there looks almost unnatural from the dragon fruit but the aroma and flavor of both fruits is incredibly authentic super fruit forward the natural tartness of the passion fruit is a perfect addition to the already quite acidic and sour base beer clean lemony lacto allowed to really develop perfect ph for the fruit i think max flavor extraction a touch of sweetness but i can still taste the wheat underneath it all good carbonation dramatic fruit flavors just short of perfumey intense concentrated not for everyone i am sure i loved how the fruits go together so well and together with the sourness awesome how low alcohol it is too this is sensational beer that deserves the high praise it is receiving nothing else like this exists to my knowledge without question the best beer with dragon fruit i have ever had,0.5609719807263145,0.9961

5224,Mother Of All Storms,absolutely wonderful beer and one off of the long time wants list for me who would have guessed it would take moving to idaho to find one in any event its worth the hype and the years of frothing for one a decadent barleywine experience with lots of barrel character a ton of malt richness and layering but not as over the top heavy and sweet as some of these can be as it has a great maturity lots of wood some tannins from the oak and enough barrel char and booze to keep it from being diabetic pretty deep amber color with some head from the bottle dense but not sedimented and high shine in the right light aroma is awesome slight oxidation over sweet concentrated grain sugars molasses and maple notes some soy sauce high end bourbon vanilla burnt wood toffee creme brulee and a fruity mix of dried apple raisin and holiday fruitcake the enormous alcohol content makes no effort to conceal itself either the flavor has a ton going on too sweet dates and molasses a little more of the soy thing lots of woody maturity and a ton of whiskey vanilla and honey notes from it some bitter char thats needed for balance here and a whole ton of booze but its warming me from the inside out in the most pleasant way this is a monster even if the body isnt as big as some of them its a slow sipper and one to cherish and savor i see why this has become sort of a cult following beer its a prime example of the style and is wonderfully barrel aged worth every penny,0.5592869955767592,0.9944

67,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,very dark brown with a tan head it appeared to be less thick on the pour particularly compared to man bear pig which we had drank before this beer boozy on the nose but not over powering which is just the way it finishes malt chocolate slightly spicy sweet molasses but not overly sweet i liked the balance in flavors  t kind of weird not saying thats bad its mostly chocolate mix of milk and dark like the smell with some chili heat on the finish every now and then i get hints of dark sugars and a bit of green apple   f medium feel a little booze burn could be thicker and richer   o its good but i wouldnt put it near its ranking it makes me wonder how awesome batch 1 was not that im ever going to get to try it its definitely worth a try if youre into pepper stout,0.5584307104969689,0.9857
837,Lou Pepe - Kriek,cherry red with a touch of amber lots of carbonation a hint of haze and a finger of pepto bismol pink head  smells acidic and fruity of vinegar cherries spices  notes of cloves and nutmeg deep cellar like funk and dusty attic just like the cantillon brewery where i purchased this masterpiece at the end of 2013  sour dry and fruity very acidic but with a softness that makes it non abrasive the essence of cherries and red fruits are in there along with the breweries classic funk and cellar and dust cobwebs come to mind and macaroni floral notes are also present  medium body moderate foamy carbonation and a very dry but smooth finish  the label says 2011 so when i purchased this in brussels at the brewery in 2013 it was already 2 years old today its been in the bottle for 5 years amazing legendary classic brew ive been cellaring in china and now in thailand for 3 and a half years it was one of my favourite days in belgium the day i got this brew may 7th 2017,0.5582309196575643,0.8919
4804,Leche Borracho,unfortunately i rushed this taste a bit dark pour with a little tan head to it this beer had a nice cinnamon backbone which ran from front to back with the peppers adding some grip and texture wellstructured and put together,0.5582003350265172,0.1027
1109,Atrial Rubicite,beautiful deep read with a minimal ruby lacing around the circumference of the glass nose is pure raspberry and some the jester king culture very dry the nose made me concerned that if was going to be pure acid suprised that it was a dry raspberry flavor with a subtleness of wild microflora feel is initially effervescent on the tounge and then quickly dissipates overall excellent think it can slightly more carbed,0.5581949715178682,0.8225
6220,Second Fiddle,great neipa has the look and taste that you want from this kind of beer hoppy but not too muchi think it beats sip of sunshine for flavor and smoothness and that says a lot from me,0.5580778062220487,0.7906
3325,Abrasive Ale,16oz can from brewers haven i didnt get the chance to hit surly when i was in mn so im glad were finally seeing distro here this one of the beers that put them on the map and its a throwback to the old days of in your face hoppiness dark golden pour with a lasting soft foamy head you can detect a hint of caramel malts in the aroma before the hops take over taste begins and ends with the hop bitterness woody piney sharp this what dipas used to taste like thanks for the memories,0.5580486718984561,0.6415
1148,V.S.O.J.,2018 vintage tasted in a snifter from draft at otooles on february 5 2019 a celebration of malt oak and patience very special old straight jacket is a cuvée of english barleywines each aged between two and three years in bourbon barrels lusciously sweet and colossally complex vsoj is equal parts refinement and excess,0.5580021643002128,0.7996

1379,Aaron,a pours a deep murky brown color with a beige colored head head is somewhat creamy has very decent volume considering the aging done on this beer but dissipates quite quickly to a ring  s this beer really needs to not be ice cold for the nose to open still its pretty faint there are notes of leather peacans vanilla pepper oak caramel and light smoke quite a bit of raisins dates and figs and maybe even dried apricot very nice and coherent but pretty low on intensity  t what it lacks in smell intensity it fucking gives back in taste jesus this beer is insane its insanely tasty with a ton of raisins figs dates and yes dried apricots you have a ton of caramel toffee vanilla smoke very smooth oak light pepper super strong vanilla leather and peacans its insanely complex and incredibly coherent if i could give this beer a 6 i would taste wise it has no faults enough for me to give a 5 on its own and is absolutely spectacular in the mouth with its intensity of flavors while still being very drinkable edit saw someone somewhere say this beer had creme brulee notes and i agree 100 there is a definite lactose like creaminess in the flavors that are very much there  m this is quite heavy but not too much surprisingly very smooth creamy and not sticky at all absolutely perfect for the genre  o man i cant say enough about this beer i havent been this impressed by a beer in at least 7 years it was cantillon saintlamvinus its very intense in flavors its extremely complex and still very coherent high complexity beers sometimes have flavors that dont complement each others this well its easily my favorite beer of all time as it is one of my favorite genres and by far the best executed beer of the genre i have the pleasure to taste  it was a very expensive beer at something like 35 usd but it was well worth it to me if i can find it again i will buy at least 4 bottles this beer commands your time and full attention imo this is white whale worthy status,0.557976309387689,0.9981

540,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,exactly what you want a german chocolate cake stout to taste like coconut and chocolate throughout with great body and aromas maybe a little on the sweet side but we are splitting hairs at that point,0.5578759513568958,0.6876
475,Very Green,just another really really good beer at a certain point all of these treehouse beers roll into one for me the differences between brews are more subtle than with other breweries they make juicy beer the right way with the bitter necessary to make it delicious and the carbonation to make it luscious just crazy good,0.5578626594971149,0.7889
1865,Sip Of Sunshine,not much more to add this beer not only tastes amazing but arguably smells even better nothing more finer than cracking a fresh can and taking a big waff of the hop freshness truly one of the best beers out there,0.5578171651405922,0.9314
3064,Cable Car Kriek,thanks to someones sister for getting him one consumed next to 07 08 09 cable car  a a loud pop of the cork and a fountain of foam gushed from the bottle spraying the windows in front of the sink we proceeded to let the foamover pour and fill multiple glasses but we still lost a good amount of beer this beer is the definition of gusher this beer is very murky cloudy and the color of pink grapefruit s i get light notes of funk and earthy but for the most pat this beer is rather sweet smelling the tartness is there and comes through in the form of cherry skins and lemon zest t sugary very sugary the cherry is very sweet and candylike rather than being fruity and ripe in fact you can taste the fruit addition that sets this beer apart from the original but its rather ambiguous and not especially cherrylike i get flavors of citrus lemon peach and prunes the funk is almost nonexistent but there is a light sourness to the brew the aftertaste coats my mouth and is very sugary sweet and candylike despite all of this the flavor profile is good just not what i was expecting nor what i think this beer should taste like m greasy and slick mouthfeel mediumfull body low carbonation and lightly tart no dryness at all o to date cable car is probably my favorite la beer and one of the top 10 best beers ive tried this beer however was just too sweet i could barely tell it was cable car and not some lindemans beer the fruit was there by it didnt scream cherries despite all of this i think a bit of age would do it some good assuming the cork doesnt pop itself off and i would definitely drink this again,0.5578090954725389,0.9938
3076,Parabajava,dark body is somewhat thin but has a heavy feel tan ring hangs out as the beer goes down  coffee is still pretty rich for being 2 years old however the base beer and bourbon barrel really dominate,0.557803628335692,0.8406
3043,Cable Car Kriek,750ml bottle 70 abv served chilled in a wine glass no bottle date  cck was one of those beers that wasnt even on my want list as i was pretty sure i would never ever get a chance to taste but thanks to the endless generosity of futur123 i am actually about to taste it thanks man i really owe you for this one  appearance the cork popped out with an almighty bang and for a moment i thought i would get away without a gush but as soon as i took my eye off the bottle pink foam started to rise slowly out of the neck thankfully i had glasses ready and managed to catch it all the beer settles a clouded redorange almost peachy with just a tinge of pink and is topped by a large pink tinted head the head retention is reasonable but sadly it doesnt leave anything in the way of lacing  smell wow there is a ton of cherry in the initial nose and far sweeter than i had expected  its almost jammy a few more sniffs reveal a fantastic acidity a touch of vinegar as well as a spicy almost cinnamon bark character as the beer warms the nose opens up with a little oak and some funk old hay wet wood mold and the faintest hint of vomit becoming apparent  taste as the nose suggested there is a ton of sweet cherry upfront but it is balanced by a nice tartness and a fantastic acidity notes include sweet jammy cherries some tart cherry skins a touch of vinegar a little oak lightly spicy undergrowth old hay and a touch of leather the finish is quite dry  mouthfeel initially there is a high level of rather expansive carbonation but thankfully it settles down pretty quickly to reveal finer bubbles that complement the acidity perfectly and lead to a fantastically spritzy finish the body is medium and offers the faintest stickiness from the fruit  overall cable car kriek is a fantastic cherry sour and quite a lot better than the regular cable car that said i would be really pissed off if i had paid 750 or what ever ridiculous price this are being sold for these days,0.5577975548805569,0.9965

1232,Vanilla Bean Assassin,2019 vintage on draft at toppling goliath  i had this along with a draft pour of kbbs at the same time the vb assassin is definitely a lot different than kbbs besides the adjuncts obviously vb assassin was pitch black with a bit of foam around the edge of glass aroma had loads of vanilla along with bourbon booze a bit maybe the flavor was soft vanilla all the way with a bit of that now common assassin dark fruit flavor serving as base underneath the vanilla goodness bit of chocolatelike flavors here too thick for sure though flavors linger for a while,0.557629983883261,0.7906
3311,Pseudo Sue,wasnt expecting the haze but after i got past that everything about this beer was solid poured an opaque raw honey color and aroma announced citra hops in spades the taste was far more balanced than the aroma would suggest and i found myself truly enjoying this beer the feel was good really good crisp and smooth definitely something i plan on drinking regularly now that its sold here,0.5576031911048843,0.9721
2158,A Deal With The Devil,batch 2 pours brown into the glass not overly thick small lighter brown head on the top 15 aroma and appearance both look and smell like cognac massive amount of fusel like alcohol waft from the glass wow this is just like smelling rubbing alcohol  taste man the alcohol is the dominant thing going on a little bit of french oak like notes from the cognac barrel up the senses and probably get the alcohol burn pairing with a drier astringency thereby totally dominating the mouth in a non consensual way it just burns the entire way through some toffee aspect to it but it still tastes like burning at this point i just have to reconcile the harsh fact that i dont like anything aged in a cognac barrel eclipse cognac masterpiece or whatever was limited for the same reasons or maybe cognac barrel aging just needs to be for far less time to contour itself to my palate limitations a lot of raisin bitterness too despite a very mild set of carbonation and decent amount of sweetness coming from where i dont know to it  i like so much anchorage stuff but this is my least favorite of anything they make no doubt because of the heavy amount of cognac influence,0.557587141254061,0.8894
818,Blessed,blackwaxed 375ml bottle the wax appeared to have a touch of concrete mixed into it  the pour is deep black with the same viscosity  head of 5w30 the nose is three musketeers bar with added vanilla  a slow base of bourbon  blessed be the person who is drinking this monster at any given moment like other insanely priced anchorage shorties this is thick redwood thick orc thick coated liberally with coconut  vanilla  hard to believe the barrels play third fiddle the bourbon isnt aggressive but deep  earthy  complex finish arrives with bundles of chocolate  a warm feeling of wellbeing that washes over me thats either the alcohol or the theanine this should come in buckets  these anchorage ba beers are stupidly priced  stupidly good superb beer,0.5575509429449419,0.8598

126,Pliny The Younger,from bottle this pours a beautiful amberyellow in appearance with good bit of foam upon aggressive pour citrusy aromas burst which make their way into the initial flavor profile before the familiar onslaught of piney and bitter notes come in for the end its a top tier west coast dipa and it drinks like it in spite of higher than expected abv it does not come across as strong or boozy it somehow maintains a smoother than expected feel its a fantastic beer and i look forward to trying this on draft one day,0.5573794536104909,0.8807

Stormaktsporter,2008 vintage served at ma che siete venuti a fà in rome  this is almost a religious experience being able to finally try kaggen pours an intense dark hue with a two inch brown head and good lacing immediately get a big whiff of chocolate vanilla and oak very aromatically pleasing the taste follows the nose with roasted malts dark chocolate vanilla and bourbon just a wonderfully smooth integration of all the elements as you sip on this and it feels as great in the mouth as going down the worst part about this beer is that it comes to an end after 25cl an absolute classic brew that i am grateful to have tried,0.5572656561343331,0.9297
1747,Ephraim,foggy burnt gold with a fluffy short persistent blanket  spicier sharper and more dank than most of hills other ipas theres notes of black pepper and a noticeable boozy triple sec character im really surprised to experience in a hill ipa but at least it makes sense with the abv i was expecting a more approachable beer just due to their pedigree but at 10 i can understand why they dont make this so often being so far outside of their usual ipa realm its not bad though by all means theres an additional note of toasted cracker in the mediumlight body as the crisp carbonation finishes semidry with a hint of vanilla on the exhale,0.5572351348549529,0.6566

1718,Beatification,currently ranked 6 in the wild ale top beers list and 70 in the top beers list with a perfect score of 100  375ml brown glass bottle with hoodandwire cap over a branded cork served chilled into a tulip as indicated is ideal on the label and even on the cork bottled 040320  100 spontaneously fermented beer aged in wine barrels barrel aged 9 to 36 months thats quite a spread fermented beer using only wild yeast and bacteria 600 abv  head none reallyjust a floater ring thats rather thin and weak dissipating in under 10 seconds  body also a bit thin and weak and certainly dull with a depleted and dareisay undercarbonated look  i imagine im going to enjoy this beer but were kidding ourselves if this is a perfect 5 for appearance  aroma oak barrelderived vanillin white wine still cidre obvious lactic acid the bacterial aromatics are much more subdued than i imagined theyd be coming inthey register but its not teeming with lactobacillus like so many american brewed sour ales im looking at you cascade brewing doesnt seem as full of life and bacteriaridden as say allagashs coolship ales but its enticing with promises of ample barrel character microfloral intricacy and diverse bacteria  i dont get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes finds in wellmeaning sour ales and i find no signs of infection some green apple sure suggesting perhaps acetobacter no vomitredolent aromatics that would indicate butyric acid are present  aromatic intensity is average for the style maybe even a bit on the timid side doesnt scream acidity but it does seem acidic judging by the aroma  taste  texture zaps with mellow acidity and puckering yet mellow bacteria hitting on all fronts pediococcus brettanomyces yeast and lactobacillus not a lactobomb yielding to the lactobacillus without letting it dominate the beers flavour profile  i cant shake the feeling this would be better fruited some source of added sweetness would help counter its dry acidity this lacks the tartness that often accompanies sourness and i think its worse for it  smooth smacky deliberately undercarbonated and to good effect i might add evoking a fine brittany still cidre a bit wet up front and a bit dry midbody  oak and concomitant woodsy flavours tie the brew together without feeling inyourface but i could do with more barrel flavour myselfid guess this particular 2020 batch was aged closer to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claimed range and that much to its detriment i dont get barrel vanillin per se or rich toasted oak and the wine character is decidedly lacking in terms of depth of flavour i mean theres faint white wine  perhaps muted chardonnay or riesling  but its not as overt or nuanced as id like  green appleapple skins orchard fruit lime rustic barnyard funkiness from well attentuated brettanomyces scatterings of microflora none of them as interesting as what one would find in a senne valley sour vinegaracetic acid grass hay maybe some faint clovespice from aged hops  i suppose the bacteria dominate maltwise i dont get much beyond 2row and maybe a kiss of cantillonlike cereal grains far from a sweet ale and i do think itd be better off fruited as noted above  overall its not a holy shit son of a bitch man youve got to try this sour ale and its not even russian rivers best wine barrel aged sour ale id tend to favour supplication in that respect but as an american imitation of cantillons spontaneously fermented sour ales theres no doubt its rather good if not quite up there with the allagash efforts in the category i dont know that id shell out for it again at this price but im glad to have gotten to try it a longtime want and a damn solid ale but i dont know that it beats the pants off your typical belgian gueuze  many of which are easier to find than this and even as imports cost the same if not a biteen less  im an unabashed russian river fanboy but while its certainly rather good the creme da la creme this is not and how anyone can give this an honest to god perfect 100 rating given its obvious appearance issues and what i imagine is to many troublesome undercarbonation is beyond me  b  good,0.5569983031555599,0.9984
3477,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,review 1500 a massive thanks goes out to cmrillo for bringing this one out during his own 40 beers  40 birthday bash cant believe i finally got to try this one 2008 vintage served from bottle into a mikkeller taster flute poured pitch black with a minimal tan head maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass the aroma was comprised of sweet malt wood dark chocolate vanilla sweet alcohol and roasted malt the flavor was of sweet malt roasted malt dark chocolate vanilla wood sweet alcohol and milk chocolate it had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation overall this was an excellent brew this was another one that i was shocked to see come out at the birthday party this was sampled directly after stormaktsporter there was a pretty good difference in this one from the base brew there was a lot more presence of the vanilla with an addition of various chocolate aspects the cigar aspect i picked up on in the base brew had disappeared but what replaced it in both the flavor and aroma was just plain excellent so glad i got the chance to finally try this one and would love to do so over and over again,0.5569693535340094,0.9862

2842,Samuel Adams Utopias,excited to finally have a utopias only a 2019 but the experience of unboxing it and pouring the bottle is second to none sharing this bottle with my bud rug based off looks phenomenal never before had to unbox a beer smells strong gives a bourbon vibe and hints of cinnamon slightly burns to smell but thats to be expected with a beer of this alcohol percentage tastes strongly of maple syrup and bourbon hints of cinnamon in the background medium feel finishes sticky overall a phenomenal experience not anything phenomenal to the senses but one any craft beer fan should have,0.5565428624970957,0.8295
1625,Focal Banger,look i had one in the can as recommended and one in a glass for comparison the beer pours a hazy light goldstraw color with different yellow hues  smell blood orange citrus peel mangos passion fruit flowers  taste follows the nose you get the orange passion fruit etc up front and it follows with pine and a beautiful floral character more bitterness than your standard ne ipa but not at all overwhelming imo excellent tasting beer  feel smooth silky mouthfeel  overall i liked this beer way more that i expected to i had it side by side with heady and definitely preferred it over heady great beer  quick note i didnt notice much of a difference between drinking it directly out of the can and drinking a pour of it but the can may have been 5 better,0.5565361001843158,0.9811

5648,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,bourbon barrel aged imperial stout with coffee which on paper sounds like the same thing a million other breweries are doing but in reality is unique as can be more concentrated and intense in all aspects than almost anything else in this field i have had before which is a large sample size for sure the coffee here is so fresh earthy and rich its roasted like crazy with an obvious dark chocolate profile that blends in beautifully with all the dark malts which in this case stand out more than in a lot of these due to the apparent lack of a sweet malty middle its all dry and roasty near black with the only sweetness at all in here coming from the bourbon which has honey and vanilla and toasted marshmallow aspects to its sweetness but its not from grain it almost tastes like an ice beer like some of the water was frozen out to make the beer thicker and more pronounced in the flavors the dark malt here is really deep and the coffee is dosed heavily enough to match it all the way through there is a lot of charred oak on this a faint hint of coconut and raisin right up front and lots more chocolate the whiskey is pretty strong here too but it brings the coffee together with the wood and the heft of the grain rich vanilla and maple notes in it and just a little warming alcohol this is amazingly complex and delicious a hell of a breakfast beer and another reason why i am increasingly obsessed with this brewery this is one of the best of its kind,0.5564161320181316,0.9962
3544,Fundamental Forces,an angry void of black is capped by a thin but solidly uniform tan blanket that dies to an oily tar black surface  the mediumfull body starts with floral vanilla which then becomes simultaneously more viscous yet hot as the bubbly froth develops a fiery breath thats hot af that said it has a good woody bourbon character thats mature and not overpowering but its just the abv that is pretty intense,0.556372781711082,0.8422

1649,Black Tuesday,2016 release reviewed on 10312020  pours a very dark brown almost no head as expected with such a high abv beer what was there was tan but went away rapidly however there is a bit of carbonation rising in the glass and its refreshing a ring of foam around the edge of the glass the nose is a boozy experience some toffee and caramel on the nose a hint of chocolate taste  boozy flavor however theres a lot more there up front i get some chocolate theres tons of toffee and caramel on the backside tons of barrel flavor throughout this is very boozy and you know its very high abv it has a warming burn but not too harsh just enough to let you know youre drinking a 20 beer fairly thick smooth also this is a sipper for sure yes i know some have chugged it but its really best to take your time to enjoy this beauty probably the biggest knock against it is the size i really dont like 750ml really high abv beers its just too damn much for one person i bet it was hotter fresh and might have mellowed out a bit with age highly recommended,0.5563574503881549,0.9814
2164,A Deal With The Devil,i am not always a big fan of barleywines but this one absolutely knocked my socks off everything about this big boy is paradoxically in your face and yet very nuanced lots of candied molasses toffee caramel drambuie cognac orange and lemon zest kiwi strawberry dates vanilla oak and even a touch of the kind of tartness one might find in a world class lambic i paid around fifty for this bottle of batch 1 and ive seen them selling on the internet for at least twice that and it would still been well worth the experience,0.556344754374131,0.6858
1614,Nectarine Premiere,opaque yellow with a large eggshell blanket  smell is very strong apple and fresh nectarine peach overload  taste is very simply exceptionally smooth soft fresh peach skin and all  with such perfect execution it brings me to a point where i wonder should i just be eating a peach but then again if i were to eat a peach would i enjoy it as much as i enjoy this no i think not  slightly tart but smooth and dry scrumptious    i was fortunate enough to try a 2019 vintage in july 2020 and it was just as impressive a phenomenal beer de garde is unmatched when it comes to any kind of stonefruit in any kind of sour beer be it lambic or otherwise,0.5563014471477219,0.9741
137,Pliny The Younger,l slight opaque honey yellow haze with minimal head s light delecate pine scent no pungent alcohol smell for a triple ipa tf very delicate dissolving starfruit and pine taste with slightly slick mouth feel and a clean finish where is the booziness is this juice o its hard not to have hundreds of questions of how they made such a world class beer but one must accept it and enjoy the moment this is the legend its a privilege to have the opportunity to taste it its worth all the hype and more,0.5562448818352417,0.9601
1449,It Was All A Dream,oily black with a surprisingly persistent creamy but thin mocha blanket  maple brulee and mocha roast are accented by sweet dark fruit and a little waxy oak via a crackly mediumlight body that finishes semisticky with a mild heat  i wasnt floored by this one especially considering the hype behind it but i had a few other beers this night that kind of trounced iwaad the complexity was lacking and so too was the pastry decadencei figured thered at least be an explosion of one or the other i guess on one hand you can say then its balanced but it wasnt quite there either pretty sweet with some heat and a mostly mild maple character i was surprised there was so little coconuti got a couple of pours to be sure,0.5562195793354168,0.9747
5710,Fort Point Pale Ale,finally got to the brewery when they had this 16 oz can dated 82719 poured into aslin glass  l hazy golden with just a hint of orange 15f soapy head with scant lacing and a ring  s peachorange with just a hint of earth and pine nice and clean  t very much mirrors the nose not sure how flavors can be both bold and soft but theyve done it what i like is the developing flavor profile from peach to citrus to ripe tropical to pineearth and in a pale ale  f moderate side of lightbody but smooth like a christopher cross song light to moderate carbonation very easy drinking construction and balance are superior  o probably too much abv to be called a true sessionable ale but this is the one you want put it right up alongside julius and its tough to pick a winner so why pick drink them both,0.5562115002959725,0.9837

1880,Haze,16oz can received as a gift from a friend purchased directly from the brewery canned on 9302020 with i want haze you want haze we all want haze stamped on the bottom so this is almost 3 months old  look pours a quite hazy yellowish orange color looks kind of like super unfiltered peachpineapplemango juice small head with some lacing  smell very pungent initially a lot of overfermented tropical fruit aroma including orange mango guava dried papaya and pineapple along with a significant green and dank finishing note a bit of sharp vegetal onion also the nose is very sharp before tasting the beer i am not sure how much i like it on its own a more pleasant pink grapefruit aroma comes through later on along with some spice  taste interesting in that this is bitter up front which you dont usually get with these neipas followed by sweetness and tropical fruit and lots of citrus rind and then more bitterness on the finish something tastes a bit off about this beer to me and i cant really place it it could be because its not the freshest almost 3 months old or it could just be that its not my taste probably the biggest positive about this beer is that the 82 abv is pretty well hidden  feel nice mouthfeel soft and pillowy appropriately carbonated  overall my third tree house beer i wish that this beer was more complex  this could be due to the age i look forward to being able to rereview this one when i can enjoy a fresher offering the flavor of this beer has grown on my since i tasted it initially but it still seems a bit lacking to me wellmade for sure but again i think that it ideally needs to be enjoyed fresher,0.5561561151779931,0.9802
3666,Everett Porter,the roast profile on this beer is almost unbelievable before even considering its limited at 72 abv bittersweet chocolate city dark roast coffee grounds and charcoal suggests a grittiness that swirls within a mediumfull body that never cloys nor removes focus from the flavor tough to tell where roast ends and hops begin both giving tremendous depth of flavor  i am most impressed with the light smokekindling character that comes through subtly on the finish almost just an olfactory sensation it really takes the roast flavor and overall experience over the top in the style ive had nothing that comes close,0.5561053893857114,0.6597

5657,Tweak,bottled oct 272017 14 bottle beautiful dark brown with not much head just a thin lip of khaki creamy bubbles activated in a thin centimeter around the edge of the glass scents bring on predominantly maple touched with coffee and bourbon the taste is primarily sweet and swims in delicious chocolate maple toffee char cherries and as it washes over the palate the bitterness of the coffee arrives the bourbon is there but not too strong and flavors the beer fortifying it with its alcoholic strength complements the coffee minutes after sipping my mouth retains the coffee and bourbon  it is an experience that lasts longer than a typical beer mouthfeel is medium thick punctuated by the tiniest of bubbles overall this is a complex and delicious beer i have to say im a fan of the high abv because i love concentrated alcohol im a big fan of mephistopheles and gave it a 55 and put some bottles away for special occasions im going to have to do the same with this because im so impressed with the experience luckily my local store has a stock of many bottles and ill probably buy them up even though theyre on the expensive side,0.5558608593260324,0.9875
3786,Susan,can dated 830 best by 927 loved this beer originally two weeks ago but these had on the best by date arent jumping out at me quite as much i actually do not think its because of age just my palate being a little different when i did this review  that aside this is still a very good ipa especially if i am patient enough to let it warm to the proper temperature from my cold fridge the look is a quite highly hazed near but not 100 opaque as with many hf beers the head and lacing are pretty strong  nose is a mix of tangerine grapefruit and some form of sweet fruit  i want to say a little pineapple theres a light herbal note that comes somewhat as a muted mint to me but is definitively a foreshadowing of some form of bitterness in the taste  medium heft maybe a little less with a prickly carbonation biting through the softer edges more citrus rind and fruit  tangerine orange and some sweet ruby grapefruit with a little huskiness from the barley andor other grains not really any of the tropical fruit accent from the nose the back end is bitter but it has an interesting sheen of maltiness to it bittersweet leaning heavily on the first part the latter keeps things from getting out of hand as expected a well constructed brew that brings both malt and hop to the experience,0.5558060399510829,0.9895
3643,Heavy Mettle,one of the best ne ipas ive had from trillium a real bench mark for the style nice thick orange body big white head smell is pineapple and mango juice flavor follows with a sweet yet dry finish allows you to keep coming back juicy as hell thick but crushable doing all of the right things for the style,0.555746056595015,0.4019
5652,Tweak,l  black as draculas nightbox great lacing a bit of brown angry foam for 45 minutes s  sat on this too long most of the character of the coffee is gone still smells like strong beer malt molasses and whiskey which is great t  more malt whiskey sugars and roast but not much coffee anymore it is a 2017 oct bottling though so thats on me still fantastic f  amazing mouthcoating veinpopping sugar content not for diabetics almost a marshmallow smores kind of sweet o _ baller stout just wish id paid attention to the date sooner so that i could enjoy more of the coffeeroast flavor and aroma,0.5557338917578425,0.9854

6104,Caffè Americano,a this pours pitch black and oily and has a sticky thicc darkkhaki head  s definitely getting the espresso on the nose vanilla comes through as does roastyness  t whoa so much going on here first off is an explosion of rich coffee and vanilla its not overly roasty which is good in my opinion lots of toffee i love the vanillaforward flavor burnt caramel and molasses show up too its sweet but rich and roasty at the same time  m very thick and sticky a little cloying but in a good way that burnt caramel and coffee and vanilla linger around for a while this beer is giving me coffee breath  o so glad i found this i almost didnt buy it because i didnt want an overlyroasted coffee flavored beer this happened in the recent past  23 gone down the drain anyway this lives up to the hype itll bring more than just a caffe americano flavor profile i liken it to a coffeevanillainfused marshall zhukov  has the same thickness and feel and the base stout seems to bring just about the same flavors very impressed by this,0.5554903162632331,0.9863
4948,Affogato,this is a very nice beer however it fell dramatically short of hype for me overall i felt like it was a very sweet version of prairie bomb slightly thinner overall it is very nice super smooth for the abv and tasty,0.5554477898558255,0.9179

2314,Abricot Du Fermier,combined notes for batch 1 and batch 2 really nice apricot notes and a bit creamy batch 2 was a bit too acidic for my taste though im fairly sensitive to that as with fou foune would prefer to drink this one as fresh as possible to avoid too much acid buildup,0.5554166494578504,0.4927

967,Ann,from a bomber pours golden smells tart citrusy only hinting at funk taste is exceptional tart opening laced with hints of honey moves into perfectly balanced funkiness the most nuanced wild saison and just one of the top 5 or so beers ive ever had i live far enough from the brewery that a visit would require an overnight stay in the area but this one made me start thinking of how to take that trip,0.5553058816683453,0.4588
3044,Cable Car Kriek,reviewing a bottle of the test batch for cable car kriek from the lost abbey out of san marcos california major thanks to paul and jonathan for sharing this rare treat with me  score 100  the only thing i know about the bottling date of this beer is that it predates the 2011 release of cable car kriek my buddy got a cable car kriek label sticker which he put on the otherwise unmarked bottle served in a cantillon stemmed balloon glass and enjoyed on 111613 review is from iphone notes  appearance pours a fingerplus of white frothy head color is a murky redorange color with a bit of yelloworange fade towards the edges of the body when held up to light excellent lacing and retention 55  smell cherry then dank cinnamon funk wood dank spice fig raisin wood and lemon hint of tobacco and vanilla lots of unexpected cinnamon present in the nose which is ridiculously complex and perfectly balanced between all the elements present just enough funk is present to give it an added dimension of complexity without detracting at all from the appeal of the other aromatics 55  taste tart cherry hits first then cinnamon spice vanilla and wood musty funk on the midpalate oddly reminisce of that cantillon house character with a little bit of age vanilla and cherrywood finish light lemon backbone dark cherry notes and a little bit of cocoalike flavor come through too as the beer warms up the cherry flavor persists throughout and lingers nicely in the finish i love how well the vanilla flavor plays with sour characters without being medicinal or coming across as being out of place all the flavors here are so perfectly integrated there is so much going on and it all works the cinnamon character is a nice unique twist though it is less prominent on the palate than it was in the nose 55  mouthfeel medium bodied spot on carbonation rare for a lost abbey beer great mix of sweet and sour with a dry finish 55  overall one of the best beers i have ever had the pleasure to consume it is complex robust in flavor tart balanced and insanely drinkable there is a reason this is one of the most sought after beers out there i would not say it is worth the 600800 it commands on the secondary market but i enjoyed it more than m which costs much more to acquire my only quip here is that someone stole the bottle from paul later in the evening seek this one out with confidence  cost 50 for a 750 ml bottle good luck finding it that for that price nowadays,0.5553046492452179,0.9928

3983,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),i dont normally start by stating the overall impression of the beer but damon is quite possibly my platonic ideal of a barrelaged stout  this is definitely a labored metaphor but remember the first time you tried everett and realized all other porters are childs play compared to shaun hills magnum opus robust porter if there were a genre of beer called robust barrelaged imperial stout damon would definitely fall right into that categorization every little complex nuance that captivates fans of dark viscous liquids aged in wooden containers is amplified beyond the wildest of imaginations while at the same time striking a perfectly harmonious symbiosis  an impossible concoction of charred oak french vanilla chocolate fudge mediumroast coffee raisins tobacco molasses and jammy figs form the heavenly aromatic range associated with this tributary beer as the brew warms up the maltbased features of chocolate and coffee take precedence over the more bourboninspired olfactory attributes of the pitchdark nectar of the gods  i quite possibly use this phrase to the point of cliché but the nose as expected is flawlessly replicated on the palate every sip of this obsidian magical concoction screams bourbon coffee chocolate followed by quiet whispers of molasses dark fruits light vanilla the flavors that bombard the tongue throughout the drinking experience remain remarkably consistent i drank this over a span of twenty minutes sandwiched inbetween pours of a different ba stout from oh and a halfbarleywine halfstout halfwhatthefuck madness from wa but the flavors remained steady and uninfluenced by the imposing characteristics of both brews upon revisiting i almost want to call this the heady topper of bba stouts given its consistency and ungodly balance of flavors throughout the entire drinking experience  the body is thicc like myas thighs im about 97 sure that this beer goes to the gym and squats three plates four to five times a week the no thighgap thickness is accompanied by a velvety creamy initial mouthfeel which oddly feels somewhat cool and refreshing to the touch i might as well just start stringing together random positiveinspiring adjectives to describe this beer and id probably still be in the ball park of what it actually smellstastesfeels like gentle simmering carbonation,0.5551388538025154,0.9951

2193,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,looks and smells gorgeous lots of citrus and tropical flavors on the nose the mouthfeel is also good though the taste flavors are more on the grapefruit than citrus side personally i liked it because it does make for a more balanced and complex beer  i was happy to have this over sunset at a brewery it just lacked something to make it a memorable beer the dry hopping with galaxy was pretty good but could be better you could tell that the base beer fort point was awesome and saved the day,0.5546447246469782,0.9749
2060,Black Note Stout,this one required at least four months bottle aging to round off the heat but after that its a mighty fine brew oak vanilla and rich medjool dates complement this wonderful stout,0.5546113935256708,0.9452
4825,Matt,was lucky enough to finally track down a bottle of matt and enjoy it with a friend strong caramel flavors in this old ale very tasty but absolutely a sipper as this was strong and boozy solid but wouldnt probably track it down again,0.5545831133212945,0.9118
3881,Montmorency Vs Balaton,bout sixfebruary 2019 bottle  pouring from a 169 oz bottle into a wine glass this beer pours out a light pink color and forms in the glass a color resembling a rose it has sea foam pink bubbles that are noisily popping the whole way through the pour  the nose brings a very real cherry element tamed and subtle it has a slight acidity i like the realness aspect but it does seem to be underwhelming overall in the nose  the taste comes in with a prominence of cherries all kinds from sweet to tart it offers a really balanced tartness that by no means trys to steal from the show a nice carbonation that leaves you burping up the flavors of cherries i dont pick up much of any barrel aging maybe a very slight dry oak but thats it i like how you can really see the cherries battling in this as it bounces from tart to sweet cherries all the while keeping it natural  overall it does end up being a bit one dimensional and doesnt showcase much of any barrel but the dimension it shoots for cherries gets nailed its a nice well made refreshing brew,0.5545574469610228,0.947
27,Marshmallow Handjee,i cant say enough about this the bourbon barrel and the vanilla beans are balanced to perfection the sweetness is cut by the smooth velvet flavor world class beer and one of the best vanilla stouts out there its one of those beers you must seek out once or many times,0.5545077079248831,0.875
3641,Heavy Mettle,poured from a can dated 2 days ago fresh into a tulip glass pours an opaque pale orangeyellow color like white grapefruit juice with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention scents of sweet tropical punch and candy ive been on a hazy dipa kick this summer so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through the description by trillium says pink starburst and im definitely getting some of that really candy like fruity flavor im also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate i have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9 because you dont even notice it so many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that abv my first time trying heavy mettle ive had one in the alloy series and death mettle and i think this one is my fav of the bunch may not be your bag if you dont like the sweetness that this recipe invokes but im definitely digging it,0.5544899759447433,0.8321
1239,Vanilla Bean Assassin,this was opened at perennial today and drank with kbbs ba abraxas and fuzzy small 23 oz pour from the 12oz 2013 vintage bottle into a snifter  a  dark obviously like every other solid stout out there with decent lacing looks thick and vicious in appearance and definitely stains the glass  s  small notes of vanilla with chocolate as well as light notes of whiskey hard to compare because i have not had regular assassin but smell is pretty damn good  t  taste follows the nose although the vanilla is somewhat muted it blends in with the milk and dark chocolate flavors that come through from the base definitely some hints of coffee in there and some bourbon on the finish although it is not that prevalent  m  mouthfeel is pretty thick and vicious not as thick as kbbs and md but it is definitely a thicker ba stout which i love  o  glad i was lucky enough to get to try this along the kbbs and the other fine brews that were drank today thanks again cory,0.5544662462177194,0.99
5178,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,poured out of a can into a tree house pint glass nose is tropical but not super intense body has a ne style haze but not super dense like some of the juice bombs flavor follows nose nothing super intense definitely tastes more like a beet on the back end than a lot of these other hazies out there overall very good but missing some of the density,0.5544589720786544,-0.9336
4304,DFPF,the color deep rich magenta and the nose total passion fruit bomb were absolutely amazing taste was basically passion fruit juice without any detectable beerness other than carbonation which left me somewhat undecided as part of me thinks a beer should taste a little like beer that said the usually enamel ripping sourness of de garde bu way down and you get jwb berliner which to me sets the high bar for all others,0.5544569333994674,0.9026
1515,Lou Pepe - Framboise,2013 bottle that was extreme could feel the smell from the bottle and the off flavors here were kind of unpleasant in the first 1520 minutes the funk was so strong we couldnt have the first sip and im not talking about horsey aromas but some kind of fisheyrotten foodmold and more after waiting for the beer to get warmer the aromas morphed into something more fruity and the framboise finally came up very very sour on the palate mid carbonation what an experience this was scary and amazing,0.5544318465716577,0.6278
5829,Sang Noir,wow i echo what everyone else has said about the beer for me its the taste of a very ripe purple mirabelle plum but brandylike with that farmhouse sour belgian ale bouche at the same time the bourbon barrel must impart the brady quality to beer the smell reminds me of a tart mirabelle not a ripe one and prepares you for the sourness dark blood sang noir sums up the color this is not a beginners beer i am smoking a montecristo no 2 and the combination is sublime not sure if its the cigar or there is a hint of aged tobacco leaf in the beer flavor profile i have some venison backstraps to cook and i think i am going to serve this with it ill update,0.5544266113934812,-0.761

5379,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,bottle 3 of 4 finally getting down to reviewing this legendary brew cork and cage 750 ml bottle and cost was a mere 870 cdn probably shouldve picked up another half dozen of these a fine way to conclude canada day served cold into a chalice  appearance  light pink or red in color capped with a tiny off white head good clarity looks the way its expected too  smell  tart very tart with raspberry and cheery and of course some balsamic vinegar but this is a more robust fruitiness than grand cru very inviting  taste  first sip was loads of tart raspberries second was all cranberry followed up with plenty of cherries wondrous tart yet sweet significantly more so than grand cru booze is an afterthought yet its packing 7 in there an its completely invisible oak shows up after a touch of warming and just adds to the complexity  mouthfeel  dry juicy tart crisp effervescent smooth each sip seems a little different and a little more magical hard to pin down but excellent tingly sensation on by tongue has me singing for joy what gets me is how deliciously easy this is to drink after every single sip i just want more  overall  simply put one of the best best beers on the planet although it might not even be favorite or second favorite grand cru and 2013 vintage ales were sublime too by the kings of the flanders ale somehow this is impossible given that ive just scored it in my top top 5 beers of all time at the moment just a wonderful array of cherries raspberries and cranberries with plenty of tartness sourness to boot happy canada day to me indeed,0.5539640356513722,0.9977

173,Mornin' Delight,l  pours a thick viscous black in the glass with just a scant offbrown head produced with moderately aerated pour the guy filling my growler apologized to me because the beer is so thick that it takes quite a while to pour out of the tap s  huge maple presence kinda hard to decide whether its a nice stackofpancakes type of maple character or straight up artificial aunt jemima hmmm also getting coffee ice cream salted caramel hazelnut milk chocolate and a hint of booze t  largely follows the nose with the hefty adjunct profile in order of intensity of flavors im getting maple coffee syrup milk chocolate vanilla hazelnut the base stout itself seems fairly unremarkable no perceivable booze which is pretty cool for the abv f  big mouthfeel minimal carb not as crazy thick or velvety as expected if anything it feels a bit on the thin side o  row 34 once again pulling the rabbit out of the hat with these togo growlers at 4232oz it was very expensive but ironically was also far cheaper than buying bottles from the brewery this years release was 8544oz split across two bottles if you took the maple out i would have difficulty distinguishing this from say trilliums night  day or other well made sweet imperial coffee stouts that being said this seems to be targeted towards the folks who dont really mind artificial flavors etc as someone who likes coffee as much as beer the fact that tg insinuates in their description that people drink lowfat vanilla cream lattes in the first place is a pretty huge red flag how about brewing something for the singlesource pourover crowd  84100,0.5539204418905298,0.9683

4473,Leaner,750ml bottle first blend from the casey side of the collaboration served in a stemmed glass  pours a beautiful hazy medium yellow body one finger white head great retention pretty much identical to side projects version smell is dripping with peach juice its more aggressive on the nose but also more aggressive is the lactic acidity which is a bit surprising as typically it is the side project that tends to have a reputation for being more acidic a bit of cheese fair bit of oak mild dusty funk but the nose is driven by peaches and there are peaches for days flavour is a bit more skewed in favor of the acidity heavy lactic acidity with a touch of lemon seems to be the main theme here same big peach flavour but it is slightly overshadowed dusty funk oak rounds things out mouthfeel is medium bodied good carbonation but as said before it is pretty heavy on the lactic acidity i dont mind it certainly but i am wishing it was dialed back a bit so i could get even more of the peach on the background of oak and dust that being said i enjoyed this one a bit more than the side project version everything about sps version that was so well done has been amplified up to a 11 so i guess it depends on what you are looking for and what your preferences are,0.5537739585374502,0.9813

4942,Affogato,split the 750ml bottle two ways chilled out in my fridge since the release not sure if some of the sweetness and coffee flavor was subdued by father time but if it was that only wouldve made the beer taste that much better to my pillowsoft palate heavily flavored stouts especially big coffee brews taste cloying and acidic i was fully prepared for this beast to be overthetop sticky and sweet but it turned out to be an exceptionally fullflavored stout with an incredible mouthfeel i wouldnt reach for a bottle every weekend but damn id sure as hell like the chance to have it more often than once  pitch black with a puffy cardboardcolored head thick and inviting when its there the head doesnt last long but it makes an impression  the aroma  like a puppy made out of german chocolate cake and expresso sitting in your lap and breathing in your face unavoidable powerful aromatic  the description is no liar  tiramisu sweet chocolate cake and smooth vanilla i shit you not brothers and sisters but as i stated before its an expert blend that pulls together the components to create a cohesive sweet slightly bitter and coffeeforward taste that slides over the palate pumps the brakes and takes its sweet time pulling away  thick viscous fullbodied huge mouthfeel like a hippo in kiddie pool  awesome beer wish i had more,0.5536172206005134,0.9932

3771,Society & Solitude #6,absolutely incredible ipa here the original style vermont ipa before everything had to get all messed up pure mosaic here too in a way i havent known these hops to be in many years like they have actually been juiced insanely fresh and like a concentrated version of themselves its outrageous in both aroma and flavor lemon and tangerine and lemongrass and pineapple notes but also some tea and flowers and botanicals like nothing else a million or more beers feature mosaic hops right now but none like this just a bit hazier looking than expected this is pretty thick and even faintly green hued nice head on it but not the brightest or sexiest looking ipa who cares when it smells and tastes like this through bursting with everything i love about mosaic hops and nothing i dont i almost think for a second there is some lactose in this not because its sweet at all but because there is an insane degree of creaminess to the soft and expansive texture like satin on the palate like i want to dive into it bitterness is really low here especially for how intense the hops are its its juicy all the way through the finish subtle notes of marshmallow french melon and kiwi fruit here too overall just a splendid ipa they way these should be and a leader in a very crowded style this blew me away dying to try the other beers in this series now,0.5533231238468198,0.9682

480,Very Green,great densely hopped ipa really intriguing to let it warm a bit and a little bit of grain and caramel actually come through as the label says i think i prefer green but this is a great variant,0.5532820999533601,0.8641
2962,Coconut Vibes,from the cask over at the cellar my golly this is incredible more intensely flavored and i think more dynamic than either of the coffee variants i have had of this one and frankly one of the better coconut stouts i have ever come across the cask pour obviously favors a beer like this frothy at perfect temperature and with an even more silky texture that i think adds to the allure but the beer is insane regardless of the format the coconut is definitely toasted it has that warming baked nutty an sweet quality to it really strongly dosed but also extremely natural a new benchmark for natural coconut aroma and flavor for sure in one of these its got just the right amount of sweetness in it and it brings a chocolate covered sort of vibe out of the malt both dark and milk roasty and rich at the same time and while this is assuredly bitter from the malt at the end it is far less so than the coffee variants were just mellow almost oak aged taste to the finish from the grain so much body but its pillowy soft starchy and heavy but also relaxing and creamy and awesome the perfect feel for these flavors coconut gets more toasty and earthy later on and it ramps up with the booze as the temperature rises and it opens up awhile in the glass an enormously impressive and delicious beer incredible amounts of coconut to this scary drinkable for its strength and just a monument to quality among the best of the shared beers i have had to date,0.5532483640073358,0.9971
4214,La Fosse,i am surprised to learn this is the same base beer as fuzzy which to me wasnt anywhere near this sour this beer seems way more acidic to me but maybe thats the impact of the different fruits on it or of its relative maturity i really dont know either way this is up there with the very best beers i have had from side project to date pale hazy lambic looking beer with a fizzy white head that dissipates fast the aroma is the best part for me woody bretty funk with citrusy bacterial tang over a pale wheaty base it is lambic at its core it seems but the fruit is so vibrant here soft super ripe apricots their absolute essence intense and amazingly enticing sometimes apricots and peaches can be a little samey in beers depending on how they are used but there is no mistaking these apricots so true to the real fruit in its best form the flavor is like that too with a lot of the sourness and wild yeast flavor and wood on the front end and all the fruit showing up later on i like the progression of flavors moving this way the fruit lingers long in the finish but the beer is very dry its a step more sour than it needs to be i think it sort of hurts the teeth like that has an overdeveloped bacterial sting and sits litle vinegary in the belly still nice bretty notes about as fruity as the apricots themselves great carbonation and a very light body a very special beer and perhaps as good an apricot wild beer as has been made in the states  edit just had a blend three from awhile ago now and it was exceedingly sour way past the point where i would want to drink even this little bottle by myself its got a nail polish remover thing going on and really is overly intense in that regard i like the apricot still and i like the flavor overall lemony and natural the fruit has held up well unfortunately this is another beer from these guys that is just way too sour at this point they have all been trending in that direction but its too much now i liked it much better when it was fresh,0.5531649189721698,0.998
730,Duck Duck Gooze,january 1st 2016  ringing in the new year with a resoundingly good and increasingly rare sour from lost abbey this treat is a lovely scent with a well toned sourness and a touch of banana esters that play second fiddle the central sourness on the tongue is also tuned to perfection with just a slight edge twisting the salivary glands and a lovely carbonation each sip is its own little rollercoaster of dramatic joy followed by the postdopamine relief in the aftertaste cycled again with a new and fresh flavor,0.5531237550633475,0.9805

3584,No Rules,purple bowling ball so it must be the 2016 version this one has been on my once list for a very long time so i am very excited to try it the smell is very much like german chocolate cake the sweetness of this beer is something that really grips you right off the bat smooth astringent cordial like alcohol blends nicely with cocoa and chocolate icing this brew is very cake like throughout lots of dark chocolate with hints of black cherry i would love to try maybe a rye barrel aged version of this,0.552951933994179,0.964

4292,DFPF,pouring a blend of ruby jewels pink and neon purple with a thin very pale purple foam im also seeing red figuratively at the prospect of being toyed with by jwb again ala troll so hard and haterade  however right away the old lady says this smells like hawaii she should know having just returned passion fruit dragon fruit and pear pop all over the nose with sweet tarts and mango dashed in  taste is really tart with a little funk where the passion fruit and dragon fruit come through surprisingly well i also get some sour apple and a hint of lemon  frothy tangy sour crisp finishing semidry  for some reason we have had a lot of guava passion fruit and dragon fruit recently having just visited hawaii among other things upon coming back it seemed like all of a sudden a number of breweries were using these ingredients in a variety of their beers you can really tell the difference between the good and the not so good this was one of the better experiences and im a little embarrassed to admit it because jwb makes two other ridiculously neon beers i love to hate on with dfpf though im not finding much i can knock,0.5528709809336251,0.9724

2819,Double Shot,huge thanks to alan for this one and plenty of other long time wants this is one of those beers you just have to try at least once so here i go  pint can  dated 011420  poured into a tumbler at 50f  pours a gleaming jet black  no head until a two finger coffee beancoloured head races up before racing right back down to a still top looking like tar in the glass like nothing ive ever seen ill give a 5 to that  nose black coffee some roasty nuance such as a hint of caramel brown sugar vanilla and even a hint of dark fruit and red wine but this is essentially sweet coffee  palate much like the nose this is an absolute coffee bomb it opens up quite sweet with lots of cocoa from the roast which lends its own coffee character as well moderate roast accentuated by the coffee but the hearty sweetness wins over secondary notes of vanilla caramel brown sugar molasses and unfortunately lactose i knew there was something unpleasant about this  theres clearly lactose in it the lactose lends this quick spike of this almost aspartameartificial sweetener flavour just before the finish where it also extinguishes any sort of roast that may have been luckily theres enough coffee for the more roasty notes of the bean to come through in the finish which helps to dry it out  mouthfeelbody the beer is fullbodied and has a slick oily feel to it in addition to the naturally full body the lactose definitely addssome viscosity here as does the sheer level of sweetness major stickiness is left clinging to the lips with this one effervescence is actually quite adequate  lower but very fine and fizzy  overall all the components of a great coffee stout are here the beans themself are clearly primo quality with zero green pepper or stale notes the base stout is wellcrafted but  its too sweet and theres just too much lactose in fact if there werent any lactose i think it could pull off the sweetness just fine but with both elements in place it does become a bit cloying i do not think the lactose benefits this beer in any way whatsoever you can easily get that chewy feel without milk sugar and it ends up tasting more natural its still good its still drinkable but id either like to see this tamed by a bourbon barrel or just lose the lactose all together,0.5526653516094617,0.9974

3322,Abrasive Ale,poured into a glass suited for beer onehalf inch of foam which recedes quickly the beer is not clear but not hazy smell is of orange light pie crust and something dank wonderful feel in the mouth carbonation is very good and it is soft on the tongue and palate i taste oranges and there is a dankness and resiny undertone that is pleasant abv is hidden well  this is my favorite double ipa but i continue to have a difficult time saying why a reviewer said it was gestalt which is a fancy way of saying it all comes together well without any attribute of the beer sticking out  i love this beer but like many others it is overpriced and i wish more breweries would follow the lead of lagunitas which continues to churn out highvalue beers at reasonable prices,0.5522928718999164,0.9871
2884,Pirate Bomb!,12 oz bottle dated 7719  poured into aslin anniversary glass and allowed to warm  l pours black barely any light brown head which doesnt last very long no lacing or cap and ring  s fair amount of rum and rum cask up front along with coffee and vanilla a peppery hint as well  t more rum and cask than i expected but vanilla and coffee take over and then cocoa works its way through and lasts with the dab of chili heat through the finish  f fullbodied not much carbonation lot going on in this beer and it is all melded very well and balanced nicely as neither the abv nor the heat get out of hand on the finish and the progression of flavors is very nice  o theyre all great but the complexity and competence may make this the best of the bombs,0.5522733442996394,0.9858
410,Fou' Foune,750ml bottle decanted into small snifters  goldenorange in color with good clarity bracing tartness on the attack but as the initial shock to the palate subsides it opens into bright and beautiful flavors of fresh apricots orange blossom and floral notes and a very delicate and nuanced funk layer soft oak to round things out its so fucking good completely captivating in its fresh and lively fruit flavor and in its balance this is a personal favorite of mine and one of the very few beers that i will begrudgingly admit lives up to the hype and then some its a real treat to savor on the rare occasions it can be had,0.5522086379432543,0.9867
4977,"Somewhere, Something Incredible Is Waiting To Be Known",brewed on 12718 picked up at treehouse on 128 tasted on 1211 cold straight from the fridge in a treehouse teku glass it looks good not an overly frothy head once it settles down has a good rich look no light gets through not as flavorful as other treehouse stouts ive tasted and at 79 alcohol you can begin to smell the alcohol esters like you would an imperial stout even though they call this one a milk stout,0.5521577120682496,0.9186

210,King JJJuliusss,canned 28 absolutely amazing cloudy orange fluffy minimal head and lacing tropical citrus notes of orange pineapple mango and grapefruit on the aroma that carry over to the taste however theres very little of the dank or bitterness ive come to find in their neipas this one is juice all the way home mouth watering medium bodied and im going to have to try to find a way not to drink it too quickly to see if it fills out as it warms just outstanding and more than lives up to the hype,0.552090411234123,0.8173

1505,Lou Pepe - Framboise,had a 2015 vintage  honestly expected more raspberry in the taste and nose as the cantillon employee said it was their finest lambic with not 200 grams but 300 grams of raspberry per liter lou pepe  nevertheless still a great beer cantillon does not have any bad beers,0.5519189441906066,0.9086
233,SR-71,this beer takes everything that is lovely about purple wax assassin and amplifies it into a sludgy browniebatterdippedinwhiskey beer overall the flavor profile is akin to assassin with bursts of fudge and dark chocolate on the palate followed by waves of raisiny dark fruit flavor the barrel presence is more pronounced with a woodier more bourbonforward profile but it never delves into the trenches of the dreaded cicerone descriptor of too hot the mouthfeel on this beer is virtually unrivaled by any other in the game  sr71 is a special beer it is not worth 25x assassin 2016 though this is one of those beers you reach for when you want that elite craft beer experience to celebrate precious moments in time,0.551882444560849,0.891
1315,Headroom,2018 batch  much more drinkable right away than last year the 2017 batch was hop burn overload this even looks more hazy and fluffy than last year the smell is amazing i liken it to perm 32 pineapple and mango overload it smells so incredibly juicy that it could be passed off as a smoothie in look and smell taste is great a lot like 32 but with less sweetness and more hop bite loads of tropical fruit as well as oranges galor theres definitely a bite here but its not as overpowering as last years batch overall really enjoyed this its not topping 32 or even galaxy cutting tiles but trillium has been putting out amazing ipas all year and this is no different,0.5518373298569973,0.9674

2998,Wide Awake It's Morning,smooth tasty and delicious smelling what else can i say basically if a stout and a maple syrup covered pancake joined forces and had a baby together youd get this beer wouldve liked a hint of bacon but overall i cant complain,0.5517084591303844,0.7403
1342,Rare Scooop,tart berry mix and roasty sweet chocolate finish im not a berry the stouts guy anyway so just not up my alley as far as flavor profile goes but thats what this is right an individual posting their own opinion on a beer happy to tick another tough top250 find but i wont seek out again,0.5516978622925512,0.743
1428,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,this beer is amazing  apparently it is better on draft but the version i had from the waxed bottle was fantastic  a terrific mix of bourbon oak salt toffee and a highly carbonated second wave of sweet molasses flavor on the finish make this beer truly memorable  this beer sits rivals bcbw 13 and aaron b1 in their prime as the best in the style,0.5516404947127537,0.9818
5017,Gueuze 100% Lambic,the beer pours a lightly foamy and white head that takes a bit to dissipate but seems carbonated enough that the glass i poured it in is creating a constant flow of carbonation to the top keeping the surface covered with a nice looking foamy head the beer itself is a clear solid medium gold color with a nice metallic appearance to it i have ever rarely seen a more gorgeous beer every poured  the smell is pretty good it starts with an herbal and orange rind and slowly reveals a slightly vinegar note at the end  the taste is absolutely fantastic the notes are not overpowering but not hidden either rather they come out fairly balanced with varying degrees of subtlety it has a decent funk note with a hint of vinegar and bitter herbal orange rind with a slightly wood finish  the feel is divine it is only slightly acidic but is not such that it is overwhelming it has a very smooth feel with a good body to it it is neither thin nor thick but directly in between  overall this is a fantastic beer cantillon earns its reputation as very good brewery and this beer is perfect for hotter days during the summer or early fall when things are getting cold but its still hot,0.551610185086655,0.9959
4761,Last Snow,another porter from funky buddha that didnt live up to the hype for me  look lightmedium bodied leaning more towards light pours black with about a quarter inch of head  nose nice coconut and coffee aromas  taste coconut is the most pronounced flavor and mildly enjoyable with a hint of coffee  feel was hoping for a nice robust porter way too thin in my mouth for what im looking for  overall its not terrible better than the maple bacon soda they pass off as beer but like the mbp with a 99 rating on this site and the great reviews i expected much more  not impressed wont do again,0.5515676163882596,0.9077
2617,Last Buffalo In The Park,both last snow and this in the same year neat jet black body with a brown head standard but well done huge coconut right away in the nose bourbon is present but light get bakers chocolate and caramel more taste is surprisingly similar while coconut laden nose is fun want more barrel for the taste malt work stabilizes the complexion though with velvet smooth coffee setting in near the finish the feel is very smooth but it is light in both body and barrel coconut defines somehow even more than ls like last snow better but still a nice porter coconut fans this one is for you,0.5515356115257297,0.9796
5298,Bodhi,my buddy had been begging me to try this saying it is the best brewed beer in ohio we have similar tastes in ipas so i decided to give it a try it was a 22 ounce draft the look is a nice dark golden color the aroma is a nice blend of citrus and pine hops the taste is the same these balance of flavors mask the 83 alcohol content definitely can drink this down pretty quick and get a nice buzz the beer is super smooth and has a nice dry finish definitely having it again at some point very very impressed may be ohios best ipa,0.5515068583817533,0.988
3859,Montmorency Vs Balaton,a pours up a murky reddish grape hue with a quickly receding white one finger head s immediate cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak there is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal t surprisingly subdued it is sour but not brutally so and the cherry is certainly there but i got some baking spice what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite although more subtle funk  there are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins m surprisingly full but still bone dry o this is an interesting beer it is much more subtle nuanced and complex than i was expecting it to be full disclosure im not a real kriekcherry sour fan so i bought this on reputation alone and while i dont think my mind has been changed about kriek i do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer i think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own fruited sour beer has never been my thing and its still not but i will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here i would be more inclined to buy them,0.5513993428971861,0.9846
946,Fuzzy,had this at the firestone walker 2017 invitational the long line paired well with the hangover i was nursing in the heat pours innocent and yellow with a chunkee or two floating around and a super thin mild head that was gone before i took a sip wow what a great aroma peach brett barrel funky yet dry pretty top notch in that department  taste oh man i could drill this all day nice soft white peach envelopes the mouth not overly acidic or sour just right carbonation on point the nice little white wine notes are complimentary it is definitely upper echelon fruited wild ale territory doubt i would ever trade for such a thing because it is so damn valued and there are comparable beers like this in my neck of the woods de garde the peach its almost as good as osos peach wild ale so id say it is running 2 in the midwest which is still a huge compliment peach and sour fans will dig it,0.5512700597076486,0.9889
5043,Coffee Abraxas,pours black as sin and thick as oil i can feel the viscosity as i pour it from the bottle small fuzz of dark brown head settles pretty quickly to just leave an oily black substance that i wouldnt let lt yar stand next to  nose focuses in on the adjuncts really nicely the stout underneath has kind of a black licorice lean to it and a roastiness thats almost more carob than chocolate the peppers lend a subtle vegetalness which i think age has nudged the coffee towards as well while the cinnamon and pepper do a good job of adding depth to some of the sweetness as well  flavour is a nice blend of the same elements the licorice and the vegetal pepper and coffee character work together in similar hues while the cinnamon and ancho and play well together the chocolate and the underlying stout get along well  the oily impression from the pour is not refuted in the experience thick and oily and smoothe with a nice bright carbonation to offset that a little bit i dig it this is up my alley im not always big on overproduced stouts or a lot of adjuncts but this is an example of where i think it can be done really well thanks harrison8 for sending this my way during nbs bif 11,0.5512414930765862,0.9688

1894,Chocolate Rain,2016 release  consumed on november 12 2020 pours a very dark brown 1 finger off white head for the abv the retention is good the head dissipates to a ring around the edge of the glass theres some decent carbonation rising in the glass that makes the ring swirl about no lacing on the glass the nose is a sweet toffee aroma from the barrels i do get a chocolate and vanilla undertone taste  like the nose tons of toffee the chocolate is really muted i dont know if it would be stronger fresh the chocolate and vanilla are on the backside very boozy which isnt surprising even aged 4 years very hot it isnt as thick as i was expecting this is an interesting beer good but you know its very strong and must be slowly enjoyed,0.5511081728719073,0.9537

3831,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee,able to score a goblet on tap from a local italian eateryvery surprised to find it around here slowly finally these really good breweries are starting distro in this area color is a dark brown no obvious carbonation but a tiny sliver of head to touch the temp was cool to room temp aroma was very coffee forward balanced like a breakfast blend smell first sips were hot from the alcohol followed by a smooth coffee presence from front to back of tongue mouthfeel was full and left a nice coffee milk chocolate aftertaste if i could find this bottled definitely worth cellaring a few to see how the burn subsides and the flavors develop it seemed a little onedimensional fresh so i imagine aging is a must for this one the straight speedway stout seemed to have more complexity fresh definitely worth a try,0.5508215164548874,0.9853
4491,Double Barrel Jesus,2017 bottling i think poured into kane chalice and let warm for an hour  l dark black with a light tan head about 1f not much retention leaves a thin light tan ring  s bourbon and barrel dominate the nose dark fruits and chocolate are minor notes this beer probably needs to be aged too bad i could only get one  t bourbon and oak predominate taste as well still room for a near explosion of dark fruits amazing and some chocolate maybe a little bit of coffee slightly sweet and a little bit of heat from alcohol  f less fullbodied than you might expect closer to medium tiny bit of carbonation still very young and boozy balance still quite good for all that  o its great but not toptier yet if i find another one to age for three years i have a feeling my score is going to increase,0.5507560555678975,0.9022

4579,Abraxas,the best mexican style imp stout ive had although there is no coffee listed in the ingredients all flavors are perfectly balanced with a crucial limitation of cinnamon which can ruin a beer altogether smooth and slick with dangerous drinkability for 115 abv the light pepper heat in the finish just makes you want to raise your glass again and again somewhere between dessert and the main course this one can do it all outstanding,0.5501737130897325,0.6249

5948,Peche 'n Brett,cellar bottle and have had fresh had been trying to find a bottle for many years and the hunt was worth it first a warning this beer is dangerous it tastes so light and peachy along with signature saison yeast character that the 10 percent abv is undetectable so smooth yet has a strong saison presence in the mouthfeel bit of an aftertaste of multivitamin with the peach but not in a bad way very balanced would be the perfect beer for a sunny picnic in july,0.5499571378428781,0.9328
6095,Blanc De Blancs,much thanks to a good friend for sharing his bottle with me a few weeks ago enjoyed out of a green 375 ml bottle but i was not able to catch the bottling date if there was one poured into a small belgianstyle tulip glass  appearance 45  pours a hazy golden color that reminds me of the color of an egg yolk but with more notes of orange and amber going on than what youd expect the head is about a finger at most and a fairly starksnow white in color it doesnt last long before fading to a ringlet around the edges of the glass and just a faint swirl of foam across the surface of the liquid  smell 45  there are a few key elements present which all combine quite nicely of course there is a fantastic lactic acidity that makes my tastebuds pucker slightly in anticipation before ever taking a sip but alongside that the vinous characteristics of white wine and oak with even perhaps a hint of vanilla and finally there is a subtle hint of white grape tartness that is different in nature from the bacteriabased sourness that is clearly present it adds a depth to the sourness that might not be there without the fruit i cant wait to dive into this and drink it  taste 475  the flavor does not disappoint with all of the elements that presented themselves in the aroma pushing through in equal parts woody musty oak and lactic sourness leads the way inducing a nice satisfying pucker and refreshing tartness as with the smell the inclusion of the wine grapes gives a bit of juicy sourness that balances nicely alongside some funky yogurtlike characteristic the finish is where the chardonnay comes through with crisp granny smith apple and white grape lingering on the palate  mouthfeel 45  mediumbodied and moderately carbonated with a lingering dry finish that entices the next sip  overall 45 a fabulous beer and my first in the biere brut style although i cant imagine that this take could be considered typical its amazing to me just how sourness as a flavor profile can screw with ones perception of abv level in a beer this one certainly didnt give away its 10 abv and ive had other sour beers that were bursting with flavor but only had 34 abv i would gladly drink this often if it was easier to get a fabulous and unique offering from side project,0.5499397689458138,0.9959
2288,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,l poured from a wax sealed bomber this beer is visually appealing with a very dark pour and a light tan thick head s a very strong bourbon scent hits you if you get within 15ft of this beast a close sniff gets you a tiny bit of cocao t this is where this beer goes from great to world renowned it is perfectly balanced with just enough cinnamon to be noticable without killing its other flavors while it smells strongly of bourbon its flavor is not overwhelmed by liquor f in truth it has a mouth feel more in line with a stout than a winter ale but thats likely because not many winter ales are bourbon barrel aged so theres not much to compare to it is very smooth on the tongue and no burn from its 13 abv o this is a truly amazing beer that im glad i had the pleasure of trying it smells enticing looks great and tastes like heaven if heaven knows how to properly bourbon barrel aged that is,0.5499251543508045,0.9937
4444,Hold On To Sunshine,canned 122818 love is all you need stamped on the bottom of the can  taking a break from the hoppy tree house beers we have the second highest rated milk stout i should note that this is not from the mixed pack i got last week but it was chilling in the back of my friends fridge and she said i could have it lol not sure how it held up over the course of a year and a half but well see  pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of espresso colored head that fades to a cap quickly and leaves nice lacing  huge aromas of dark roast coffee dates chocolate malts and lightly roasted peanuts a nice combination of smells here  the beginning of the sip is surprisingly light with mild coffee and char the finish brings more roasty creamy peanut butter and dark fruits not as good as the aroma suggested but still quite sweet  a medium to full body with almost no carbonation this drinks smooth and finishes sticky no alcohol heat from the 76  so this was good but it could be better to be fair this is a milk stout approaching 2 years of age so ill take what i can get,0.5498884002351793,0.9824
2239,Triple Shot,no bottling date but i picked this up at the brewery way back on 61319 it says not to age but i wasnt in a rush to drink it with so many other beers in the fridge having shorter lifespans  pours beautifully as a beer this big should nose is quite boozy but everything is there the flavorfeel is soooo creamy so damn roastymalty the coffee is massive i love it dark chocolate and espresso roast coffee dominate the entire experience slightly sweet perfect bitterness amazing drinkability for the statistics of this beer worldclass,0.5497837516752544,0.9517
3194,Scaled Way Up,l bright yelloworange attractive  s slightly earthy and very fruity nectarine skin and peach flesh and orange juice  t had fresh on draft the day it was canned picked up a lot of hop burn and bitterness almost an unenjoyable amount 3 weeks later the can im enjoying still exhibits sharp bitterness and not much else there is zero subtly here and yes i know the point is to scale things way up but this literally hits just one hopburn note disappointing for sure  f more balanced than some recent trillium offerings not as sticky sweet with this one  o ehhh not worth the hype at all like so much of what trillium offers nowadays,0.5497091981282132,0.3779

1629,Focal Banger,this was the best beer ive had in a long time the can reads that you should drink from the can so i didnt get the colour however the can had a good look to it so i rated that a three and a half the smell was pure tangerines and mango very good smell the taste was crisp with piney mosaic hops following the fruity taste at the beginning it does have a little bit of a bite on the aftertaste rather bitter finish,0.5493509416637393,0.8173

2334,Breakfast Stout,this stout blew my mind at my first sip sometime ago for whatever reason i am preferring stouts porters red ales and bocks over ipas which were my preferred brew for a long time the flavors of breakfast stout rolled over the palate with many delicious surprises it was a while ago my first experience with a coffee stout lots of body too i wrote to founders claiming and surprisingly they answered me top shelf,0.5492754993976637,0.8934

5817,Schaarbeekse Kriek,october 2008 vintage strongly colored from the cherries but it has a murky dark garnet color which isnt the most appetizing minimal carbonation and no real head or lacing the cherries have surely mellowed over time but theyre still very much present and seem to have a more earthy flavor presumably from the addition of the schaerbeekse cherries acidity is very strong and its quite puckering at times but never gets over the top a nice beer but it didnt quite live up to my expectations,0.5492059195116673,0.9244
1939,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,12oz bottle with a date thats hard to read but its there and im pretty sure it says manifested on 91818 or something close totally opaque and surely the most neipa of any neipa ive tried to date when it comes to the hazy train murky pale orangeyellow colorhard to describe 12 white head with falls to a cap rather quickly no lace juicy with pineapple and berry aromas oranges too and grapefruit  the red type orangepineapple juice its good but thats what it isnot much complexity full bodied and round mouthfeel very easy to drink and very little bitterness some heat a touch of a drying out of the mouth affect late its very good but im at a 4no more,0.5492051349684276,0.9607
958,Ann,2014 batch drank on my wedding day 1202017  lslight haze bright lemon gold with a white head  smell and taste follow each other which is best stated as complex the honey and lemon come through nicely just like anna and theres a nice tartness added as well the wine barrel is prevalent and adds a nice level of bitterness and oak i would have guessed a subtle red wine barrel but it seems more like chardonnay is the likely barrel used makes perfect sense earthiness and floral tones were present as well and the overall lingering unique note was something either cinnamon or comparable to it it was really incredible within everything else in this beer  feelsoft drinkable delicate  overallexceptional due to the whaleness of this beer i highly doubt i will be able to drink this again but man it was great very enjoyable perfect wedding day celebration,0.5491130097092944,0.9874

1962,Triple Sunshine,probably the bestsmoothest of the triple ipas that ive had with that said the style itself is a bit over the top for my preference the booze overpowers everything else some flavors of overripe peaches and white grapefruit but the booze washes over everything and lingers some residual sweetness with the boozy aftertaste overall probably the top of the class for this style but the style isnt my preference,0.5490825499636112,0.7845
1389,Aaron,this one pours a nice looking brownruby with a thin head that breaks into a cap and collar the cap doesnt last long and the collar leaves some minor lacing in its wake  the smell is divine sweetness leads the way with brown sugar and dark fruits then you get a touch of barrel notes and it finishes off with mild hops  taste is like the nose being led by the sweetness in spite of a strong sweetness there is a nice balance with the barrel notes which is quite subtle and then the hops finish this is a real enjoyable sipper  feel is full with lower carbonation there is a sticky coating finish to this one and the sweetness lasts while i can only assume a high abv this is a well hidden aspect  wow what a great beer i mean this is top ten for me such a beautiful sipper i was very sad when it was all gone the flavors are so nice and they meld so nicely if you are a fan of english barleywines run dont walk to try to get a bottle,0.5490597839261274,0.9928

5486,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,thanks to joplamp for this one from the recent cancans bif 12oz bottle packaged 518200 poured into 14oz teku poured the expected solid black color with less than 14 inch of tan head that quickly dissipated and left no lacing  sweet vanilla and bourbon at the front of the nose with some oak but the base beer flavors were very muted just a touch of alcohol heat  very similar on the tongue but the roast aspects of the base beer show a bit stronger  the body was thinner than i look for in the style but was smooth and had a finish that started sweet but dried out after a few moments  drinkability was good no issues especially for 13 brew  overall a nice beer certainly but not one that particularly stands out from other examples of its ilk worth trying,0.5490332523699565,0.9553
1806,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,finally got my lips on this one an extra hopped version of their now famous pale ale and its predictably awesome the thing about this and about so many of the dry hoppy trillium beers really is that they seem to know when to stop and in some ways i like this as much for what it isnt as i do for what it is its not green and vegetal and forced over saturated harsh or bitey and that alone makes it better than so many others out there in this style right now soft yellow even light greenish in color its muted looking thin and nicely bubbly it smells awesome citra all over this but not modern day citra like citra when it first came into vogue and nobody could get enough of it so distinctive and fresh lemony and lemongrassy with a beautiful freshness to it that almost is as relevant as the aroma it contributes light green tea a softly starchy but dry grain base and a level of refinement evident that i am not used to in these the flavor is as good as the nose pineapple and honeydew and lemon zest all come to mind but this isnt intense for all the dry hops it has they seem so well integrated not just on the surface but fundamental to what this is and that is rare light bitterness at the end but enough for this to appear balanced awesome carbonation makes it feel really light and the grain base is dry and simple but rustic enough to contribute something and i really like that with the juicy hops in here a really worthy beer highly acclaimed and for good reason,0.5490025307721714,0.9904
2958,Coconut Vibes,original review was b1gave it a 445  b2 was a huge step up in mouthfeel sweetness and overall coconut flavor not sure ive ever had a stout that has the same authentic coconut flavorfloaties included,0.5488592970323972,0.7606
4786,Leche Borracho,a 2018 release packaged in a 500ml bottle  while filling the teku halfway it is a viscous stout that produces a fairly frothy brown head that not only has great retention it never disappears there is a constant film on top that tapers up to a thicker cap sized ring around the glass  first thing i can smell is definitely cinnamon tequila is also noticeable to me it seems more like a white tequila because i tend to think it gives off more gin like floral notes otherwise there is a hint of a sriracha like pepper sauce and chocolate  wow the flavors really pop a bit of tequila aged this time up front followed by chili peppers that deliver way more flavor than heat but just enough bite to offset the sweetness and play off the by far most dominant flavor of cinnamon that is there throughout it rounds off into a cocoa powder like chocolate with a touch of smokiness and lingering baking spice as it warms there is some vanilla in the finish too very nice combination of flavors my only knock would be the sweetness starting to creep up the ladder as i make my way through it  the body stands out the most which was the case for the very first beer i ever had of theirs i said at the time that they were in the league of bourbon county and firestone walker lush velvety and significant yet so easy to drink there is some tingling from the peppers  personally i think that a touch more heat would put this right there if not ahead of mexican cake for the best spiced stout i have had but it is definitely at a level that it should appeal to everyone,0.5486518260842732,0.9925
2303,Abricot Du Fermier,this is really good no doubt about it but not as good as they say it is i dont reckon and once again a side project beer doesnt quite live up to its hype their culture has trended super sour lately and this is another expression of that just really acidic beer complex still still lots of nuance bretty funk and oak and all but its the bacterial intensity that takes over this one and makes it a hard large bottle to drink even split a couple of ways i really like to let these types of beers warm up a little bit but not here its best when its colder with temperature comes acidic intensity thats hard on the teeth and belly i like all the apricot of course about as natural as it gets super ripe and even soft and fuzzy like the real fruit very forward and incredibly natural and delicious the authenticity is through the roof i kind of wanted to taste more of the wine in the barrel profile which is tannic and heavily oaky but not as red wine forward as i might have thought for cabernet all the wood is nice subtle vanilla and even white tea somehow killer with the apricots peach juice notes even green apple and white grape wrapped up in here lots going on but instead of mellowing into a slow tart bretty funkiness like i wish it did the sourness cranks and disrupts the delicate beauty it finishes harsh and big i mean in all respects this is great beer but it just doesnt stand with the best wild beers in the world to my palate maybe those who prefer a more assertive acidity will disagree but i think its a little too much unflattering to the fruit and at 45 a bottle it just doesnt do it for me,0.5486180759885876,0.9939
663,Dinner,did not think anything could be better than lunch i was wrong pours a beautiful light orange with white head the hops hit you as soon as you pour it lots of mango and apricot goes down smooth with a little stickiness on the tongue,0.5485919288663033,0.5719
2389,Miami Madness,really well done berliner type with tropical fruit its one of the better fruity berliners i have had and one of the best uses of these fruits i have seen in any beer and while i loved it im not sure it ranks among the best beers i have ever had overall and wasnt even my favorite beer from j wakefield although its probably still deserving of most of its hype doesnt look like much orange and hazy quite thick for a beer so low in alcohol the aroma is shocking intensely sour acidic mouthwatering puckery all of it with the passion fruit leading the charge but the other fruits quite authentic and obvious in the aroma as well juicy and intense really different from other beers more and more fresh the flavor matches the aroma with a real intense fruity complexion passion fruit and orange and mango for sure all really alive and bold in here but never too sweet thats the brilliance i think keeping it dry it doesnt feel light to me though lots of body and texture and even the high acidity doesnt lighten it up much surprised its so clean too gone but the palate begs for another gulp as soon as it is swallowed this is not a style i usually flock to especially with these fruits where more often than not its gimmick over quality this is awesomely delicious a leader in its class no doubt,0.5485422167506483,0.9927
2383,Miami Madness,5s across the board no doubt about it this blows all other berliners i have tried right out of the water l looks just like an orange juicepassion fruit juice great bright solid darkyellow appearance s this is where it hit me hard huge aromas of passion fruit and guava right up from the mango is perfectly evident as well citrus nice subtle funkiess one of those things that make your mouth water just smelling it t fantastic great heavy flavors of passion fruit and guava with a nice sourtart funkiness sour mouthburst was not too subtle and not overpowering so it was easy to work my way through the whole bottle again the mango was evident but backseat to the other two fruits f mouthfeel was just smooth enough not too sharp and the aftertaste was tart and juicy overall this was one of the best beers i have had this year i was already a big fan of passion fruit but this beer really nailed it wholeheartedly worth the effort to get this and i will be pursuing more of this in the future,0.5485089539835274,0.9876
3189,Great,on tap at alpine 12222015 on release day not a big fan of barelywines i like them but would always prefer a stout or ipa that being said great and a deal with the devil are the only ones i would hunt great is amazing this year around they found a way to improve a already great barleywine bourbon followed by notes of caramel toffee raisins and sweet fruit that are velvety smooth and silky the nose is just as amazing as the taste,0.5484769782098154,0.9877

5729,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),poured into a fremont small snifter pours a very dark mahogany brown appearing opaque black in the glass with a thin dark khaki head that dissipates to a few patches with a slender ring around the glass nearly still aroma of dark toasted malt whiskey molasses mild dark stone fruit and caramel flavor is rich dark toasted malt whiskey caramel dark chocolate and oaky vanilla medium bodied with moderate creaminess light carbonation but silky mouth feel wow im a bit in shock this was one a number of nearly ten year old stouts i found in the back of the basement most were drinkable but all were clearly over the stage of improvement from aging not this one i wasnt even going to review it due to its age until i tasted it although the near still pour was expected from great age the aroma and flavor are outstanding there is little or no oxidation nor other overage flavors the malt chocolate and whiskey are all nicely integrated and fresh tasting whiskey is at a perfect level i now wish i had continued to save this for the special occasion it was set aside for this would have been an excellent bottle to share i see that i paid a lot for this in 2012 but it was well worth it and now i wish i hadnt passed up other more recent versions due to the price point this is a worthwhile splurge that held up superbly extra points for tasting so good at 8 years old,0.5483847874665677,0.9971
72,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,batch 2 snifter shared with my brother  l black oil quarter inch brown head that sticks around for a minute or so s molasses brandy rum cocoa really hits the nose nice t cocoa and vanilla hit quickly followed by the barrel character theres a nice combination of the rum and the brandy character definitely booze but i think its drinking really well right now the finish is very much chilis which stay with you as you take more sips absolutely delicious m medium mouth feel would have loved a little more thickness but only a small knock here o absolutely world class the smell continues to carry through and as the beer warms you really get very nice barrel character black strap molasses vanillacocoa and all the chilis on the end world class and drinking great,0.5483847033848733,0.9887
1278,King Sue,from the bottom of the can pkg051321 145224 best by 091021  appearance the body of the beer is a light colored milky beige that is completely opaque the head is white and frothy with mostly large bubbles it doesnt seem to create much lacing but it has decent retention and alright formation  aroma it floods the room with aroma as soon as the can is cracked and pouring it only sends out the aroma even more the beer has a nice grapefruit aroma and a bit of a wildflower scent the aroma isnt very strong in the beer but its nice there is a clear presence of aroma but getting close to the surface of the beer shows how muted it is  taste up front there is a bit of passion fruit flavor along with some grapefruit these flavors carry on to the middle of the palate where a peach character joins in the party  mouthfeel it has a mediumlight body with a mellow bitterness there doesnt appear to be an abv listed on the can but it does state that this is a double india pale ale and whatever abv it has it does a good job of hiding it which is noteworthy its also very easy to drink  overall its a very enjoyable new england style double ipa the beer has a very good delivery and the flavors change as they cross over the palate the beer is very fruity and has a mild bitterness so it could pair well with brunch foods it would be a good beer to drink for any occasion but it would probably shine during a holiday brunch or lunch with family and friends i would definitely buy it again and i would highly recommend it,0.548371755022877,0.9931
6203,Second Fiddle,this is a beautifully made dipa that i just dont like very much beautiful bright amber with a dense white head and expected haziness the aroma is bright like smelling mint but very subdued and without any specific aromatic character except for dankness the taste is also bright and cool mintlike but without any distinct malt or hop flavor that is appealing the flavors actually exists for a brief moment  but disappears immediately into a clean bitterness that erases any impression of what you have just drunk the body is more like an ipa than a double ipa which isnt necessarily a bad thing im sure this will appeal to those who are looking for a clean refreshing blast of alcohol but im looking for more aroma and flavor in a dipa,0.5483629103399474,0.9752
3294,Pseudo Sue,smooth and juicy crushable at 58 but costly i enjoyed this beer immensely  smooth on the tongue and soft on the way down a beautiful hazy color a champagne of beer,0.5483380582462506,0.9186

1895,Chocolate Rain,boy oh boy you take an already infamous beer and up the ante by adding vanilla and cocoa gnarly its a beastly beer that is a true sipper if ive ever seen one its rich dark heavy sweet and delicious the addition of cocoa and vanilla add flavor to a beer that honestly didnt really need any help but somehow serves as an upgrade great beer share it with good friends dont drive afterward,0.5480174366279478,0.9798

5356,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,poured from a 750ml bottle in to a tulip glass  look has a nice clear red color with a short lasting white head  smell smells of berries and slightly sweet also with an acidic touch  taste tastes closely with how it smells although with very little sweetness overall which is a good thing to me for this type of beer  feel slightly fizzy not a heavy beer  overall usually with size of beer im a believer in sharing with someone else to then move on to another but i am always tempted to hog this one will drink it whenever i find available,0.5477638606774783,0.8174

817,Blessed,this beer is next level reminds me of og vanilla rye on steroids has a bit more barrel and vanilla overpowers the coconut a bit but the sweetness is perfect in my opinion glad to be lucky enough to have acquired a bottle really nailed it here,0.5477049745973706,0.9587
2428,§ucaba,2019  ive had loads of barley wines in my day and they can all be problematic too much alcohol heat too drying a vague cough syrup taste etc theyre big beers and if one aspect of them is over pronounced it can be a really hard beer to finish  this 2019 ucaba is nearly perfect its slightly sweet and subtly blends boozy vanilla and oak flavors together with a rich maltiness theres not one flavor that really stands out its perfectly blended  its one of those beers you have a tough time coming up with words for youre too lost in the moment the only downside is of course its 15 plus 12 oz bottle and it goes too quickly,0.5475762396999855,0.7517
2720,Blåbær Lambik,my first experience of this was at dark lord day written below i had a bottle at home so what follows first is my review of that 2018 bottle opened on zwanze day 2019  appearance is foggy vibrant burnt red with a tall uneven pinkishwhite foam head that slowly settles to s thin film and creamy collar  blåbær exhibits tanniny skins and hella oak that has a nutty splintery dusty character the lambic has an olive brine funk and is more sour than other loons but it needs to warm up to develop away from vinegar with more pleasant notes of red wine as the prickly semidry finish becomes smoother as it warm  in both experiences i never really got a definitive blueberry character but that has been the trend with many other blueberry lambics and saisons ive had across the board    yep i got to enjoy this lambic whale at dld it was fluffier than i expected and expressed more oaky barnyard funk than it did fruit but was quite enjoyable i didnt flip my shit over it but i didnt get a full glass of it either,0.547557278653693,0.9736

5151,Clare's Thirsty Ale,this is like a sweeter version of backyard rye perhaps the biggest surprise of the night at a recent tasting certainly worth trying or seeking out if you are into fruited chocolate truffle flavors in your stouts,0.5474135735405622,0.7845
5408,Thicket,blend 2 magic the best of the side project little bottles ive had in years i think its not as sour as so many of them have started to become maybe its because its fresher but the base beer is old anyway so im not really sure more likely its just balanced out by all this fruit just an absolute load of the blackberries this is fruit heavy as they get and all the berries seem necessary to balance a rather intense and complex base beer this is really good worth the hype although maybe just a little raw and unrefined in the bottle its a deeply stained blackberry color but has a lot of haze and murkiness to it some particulate in there as well looks almost like fruit skins cant complain about authenticity but the beer doesnt quite sparkle even though its bubbly enough and holds its airy white head rather well aroma is blackberry and blackberry jam couldnt be more obvious and there is nice tang and funk here too lots of oak red wine light fruit vinegar and raw wheat really impressive and interesting and the boldness of the blackberry is as intense as ive ever known it in beer my mouth waters like mad to taste it the berries are as prominent in the taste crazy maturity woodiness and juiciness as well even the less enthusiastic beer drinkers around our table are impressed with this the fruit and the sour are great together the complexity is enormous and the fruit is sun ripened and real as can be here not all that acidic i could easily drink the whole bottle myself which isnt always true of their beers and the bretty part seems well developed too great carbonation on this and some solid blackberry linger one of the best ive had with this fruit truly wonderful beer,0.5473352886384486,0.9973
3723,Double Stack,best part of waking up 050619 stamp by rim poured into a snifter  a black with 12 finger dark beige head with good retention and sparse lacing  s unbelievably uncanny aroma of pancakes with butter and syrup with black coffee more present with warming  t the flavor is unfortunately hampered by a strong bitter burned coffee note and then extractchemical character in the finish and aftertaste the maple is strongest early and then fades the background stout also doesnt come through much disappointing given the unbelievable aroma  m hides the 11 well with smoothness but slight extract tang in the finish  o double stack has good points and bad points i am fairly sensitive to the artificialchemical extract flavor and feel so it can rear its head in a beer like this one for me depending on the reliance on on extracts to get the finished flavor and feel,0.5473056563429477,0.7705
3123,Framboos,season 1718 blend no 16  drank on february 17th 2020 not quite the fruitforward framboise that id expected framboos has quite a lot more oak and sourness than the tart berry that im accustomed to the nose is wonderful and the barrel plays well with the tartness beautiful pour though not quite so dark as the krieks and framboises im more experienced with quite good,0.5472670864693875,0.9134
14,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,this review is for the 2020 kbbs from the tg taproom in decorah iowa i had a four ounce pour  look the pour is thick like motor oil its super dark with minimal head its syrupy in the greatest way when swirled the the beer nearly stains the glass brown leaving amazing legs  smell this is incredible for many beers you pick up subtle aromas for this beer you immediately get inyourface maple syrup followed by coffee bourbon and dark chocolate there is nothing subtle about these aromas you dont have to try to identify them you can smell them from the moment the glass is placed on the tableits as if theyre serving you breakfast  taste much like smell there is nothing subtle about the flavors once again the maple hits you hard immediately with bold flavors of chocolate chip pancakes with butter the coffeeespresso flavor comes next accompanied by bourbon the flavors are extremely bold deep and wellbalanced its a symphony of flavor perfection  feel i debated on including sweetness in the flavor but it my opinion this particular sweetness is more about feel than flavor you can have flavor without sweetness ive placed it here because the sweetness contributes in such a way that the entire feel of the beer is elevated it adds a richness thats hard to describe it eliminates any boozy feeling while keeping the warmth you get from a high abv drink its coats your mouth entirely and the feel and flavor last a long time  overall i dont typically prefer stouts but killer stouts are toppling goliaths bread and butter i was worried that i could potentially be disappointed due to all the hype surrounding this beer not only did it live up to the hype it exceeded my own expectations it left me wanting more i was fortunate to try mornin delight termoil fluffernutter termoil smores kaiju clash and coconut assassin all on this particular dayeach one was phenomenal but at the end of the day it was kentucky brunch brand stout that reigned supreme,0.5472436391184338,0.9864
5697,Hop JuJu,finally had a chance to try this iconic beer as is the nature of things this beer is a huge credit to history and the early expansion of huge bitter west coast style dipas somewhat reminiscent of a pliny etc clearly remains an outstanding beer but now the bitterness and dank quality seem overstated the creamy deep maltiness has a slight bit of a cloying and syrup 10 years ago i would have marveled now it seems somewhat pushy even a bit harsh in the aftertaste cant give a negative review but i guess for me ive just moved on have had enough huge pine and resin brews regardless of any citrus or malt contribution glad to have finally tried it,0.5472322276856978,0.8119
5130,Clare's Thirsty Ale,part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by fbarber during nbs bif 13  gorgeous pour body traps light completely dark lovely finger of soft dark brown foam quite the beaut  nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough theres a hint of raspberries layered in there as well inviting  the berries are much more prevalent here beginning at the first sip it starts off as just kind of a general berryfruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components i will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note well come back to this later the build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel this brings us back to the raspberry you know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness its one of the great things about them is they offer a balance and a range of experience and that presents here the finish has some bitter from the coffee and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there to give it a little ooh to the finish really enjoyable  body is velvety smoothe and that tart finish i descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein would not descibe it as hot but it isnt shy about its double digit abv  im really enjoying this raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing but i feel like i still dont see it quite as often as id expect in beer i think it really really works well here and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it thanks frank,0.5472078687782022,0.9938

3059,Cable Car Kriek,thanks brad served in a lost abbey teku glass because thats the way god intended this probably goes without saying because the geniuses at lost abbey are incapable of getting it right at all but this beer is severely over carbonated dangerously so lost more than half the bottle to the gush and the bottle was served super cold and we were anticipating the gush regardless it was a gusher  beer is pink  ruby and really hazy with a thin pink head of small and medium bubbles low retention lots of carbonation no lacing  aroma is sweet cherries tart mildly acetic mildly lactic some succinate in there interesting mild earthiness and sulfur smells like a cherry lambic  beer is bright on the palate from both the carbonation and the mild acetic character to it very tart in the corners of the mouth and very good overall it is still quite sweet and if there is fermentation happening in the bottle i fear what this beer will become  on a side note this was sampled side by side with the batch 1 release that was reportedly too sour to serve it was still a gusher but not nearly as bad kind of slow motion gusher the beer was clearer still ruby  red  pink thinner head more acidic but not overly sour i heavily preferred the batch 1 to the batch two for more reasons than the difference in carbonation it was a better beer my score reflect the batch two though since if you are one of the few people cool enough to get a bottle of this for on site consumption at that prick bar in sf this is the one you will get,0.5457751834551507,0.942
5820,Schaarbeekse Kriek,this is an absolutely beautiful lambic this bottle had no overpowering sourness mentioned in other reviews also no medicine  amazingly clean with subtle funk cherry lightly sour light body mild carb with almost no pop when the cork came out but nicely effervescent when swished again its a shame i didnt get both dusty bottles off the shelf i would love to have this again maybe with a few less people everyone absolutely loved it even the i dont really like sours guy at the share,0.5456996892063805,0.933
6024,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,poured out as a black color pretty thick looking with minimal head on it the smell of the beer is similar to regular black tuesday so im not picking up much of the rum barrel the taste is huge like its original counter part there is a subtle spicy notes that could either be the rum notes or possibly just the booze burning a bit the feel is heavy rich and silky with some boozy heat on the finish overall it was a fun beer to try but not much different than regular black tuesday,0.5456941823874516,0.8225
3165,Great,vintage 2015 i was super excited to finally land one of these particularly an older bottle  it has aged quite wonderfully the pour is quite a lot darker and more opaque than id anticipated the barrel and light caramel are pungent zero sign of oxidization i really like this beer,0.5456801865742881,0.9229
369,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,brought out to do a side by side with the regularbrandon youre the man  the beer pours jet black with the same dominating viscosity and residual oil left on the inside of the glass while drinking the nose has notes of buttery apple brandy oak and booze the taste is sweet rich and boozy but so balanced and smooth its nuts the apple isnt as prominent as expected but there is a slightly tart apple aftertaste thats an exceptional addition to one of my all time favorite stouts excellent beer thats completely worth the acquisition hassle that i myself didnt have to do,0.545599458406827,0.8792
2902,Pirate Paradise,batch 1 that ive been holding onto for a while first thing i noticed was the strong vanilla aroma very strong in a very good way has a fudgyvanilla taste w a strong after taste of toasted coconut and has abv hidden well overall right on par w bourbon paradise prairie might be making the best stouts right now  alongside w toppling goliath damn do i wish i could get this often,0.5454808662467576,0.9747
2336,Breakfast Stout,classic oatmeal stout the appearance is ideal lacing is prominent and lasting aroma is ideal for the genre and the flavor so full of coffee and oatmeal and malts and cocoa just really tasty the feel is near perfect for an oatmeal stout and as far as over all this is one that will definitely always be in my cellar,0.545465236280184,0.9509
4261,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),330 cl bottle from etre gourmet pours a brownishamber with a moderate head hits the usual dubbel notes of raisinfigmalty caramelhint of spice from the yeast  but also is surprisingly boozy and bitter overall obviously im glad to have tried it but i will happily drink 56 dubbels from chimayrochefortst bernardus rather than spending 15 or so on this again,0.5453697530103191,0.8402
6014,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,thanks to ctjman for answering my plea a while back ive been looking forward to this one  since i dont have to wake up tomorrow i mean i will eventually i hope its time blackwaxed 750ml bottle split with my wife  the wax isnt too bad  the beer pops loudly upon release foreshadowing lively but shortlived visible carbonation though it keeps audibly crackling for a while the nose is dominated by rum  sweet corn syrup  while there are probably subtleties they arent easy to spot under that onslaught  black tuesday  rum barrel aged is a decadent rumsoaked caribbean sunsplashed treat rum lights up the palate over a base of enough malts to denude multiple acres powdered sugar soaked in sugar water  drizzled with brown sugar rich toffee syringe of alcohol to the brain stem light spiciness from the rum i presume  the only light thing about this monster vanilla high quality maple syrup did i mention the alcohol or sweetness full thick oozing im going be enjoying this halfbomber for a long while  id be happy to have had the other half too  i love alcohol sweetness  rotting my teeth so why wouldnt i love this i do this is in the upper echelon of barrelaged stouts  the best of the variants ive had to date absolutely stunning,0.5453285514720051,0.9937
1976,Doppelganger,thanks for the share bryan this is just another in a long line of tree house ipa i have thoroughly enjoyed flavor aroma and mouthfeel top notch,0.5453284928490059,0.8588
1796,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,can dated 101920 poured into a tulip glass getting lots of tangerineclementine and mango on the nose the flavor is where this one took a weird turn for me  there was a strong vegetal flavor that overpowered everything for me through the mid and finish kind of onion or garlic or maybe some parsley maybe thats it because im not a big fan of parsley still really respectable but not as tropical and fruity as i was expecting smooth finish not too heavy or syrupy with some lingering hoppy bitterness this was can 1 of a 4 pack and has been stored cold the entire time so ill definitely give it another shot and maybe see if it changes over time sadly this one might just not be for me and not my fav ddh offering from trillium,0.5453264619852359,-0.8753
1913,Chocolate Rain,2016 from bottle into chalice  very little foam on pour brownamber in color more of an appearance of a barleywine rather than a stout barrel character here is huge loads of bourbon and oak chocolate was present on the nose and in the taste along with some mild vanilla as the beer warmed but make now mistake this is hot and this is barrel boozy if you dont like the heat you might want to sit on this for a few years,0.5452707450425224,-0.4147
6037,Fyodor,l dark black except where light fringes the glass for a chocolate brown a third finger dark mocha head with little retention or lacing  s this is a boozy bourbon punch in the nose even after 9 months bottle aging the smell is not a delectable bourbon rather it smells like everclear 190 proof with some vanilla for good measure i definitely dont get anise haha or any finer thing like that  t anyone who says anise in my view is copying the notes this is booze and far from beer finery i dont get bourbon heat instead the taste of vodka with the smallest amounts of oak vanilla and chocolate in descending measure  f the mouthfeel is lightmedium and astringent not thick as described but decent enough to pass for a lighter ba stout carbonation is medium low but okay  o overall i am saddened that stone got my money on this one their description is bologna which is an italian derivative id rather eat again than to consume this vodkaladen russian beverage it is not a mess in that it isnt all over the place however it is offbalance towards a spirit rather than a beer and ive had 199 percenters with far more finesse even if you are a bourbon lover this bomb is not for you as the bourbon or vodka isnt all that good,0.5451999366409512,0.0818

2546,Beyond Good And Evil,this is a review of the 2015 version that was on tap in october 2019  hill farmstead  pours black 13 brown head aroma reveals that both the coffee and maple have meldedfaded into the bourbon notes i like that sweet spot where things gel more than being led by one dominant aspect generally equal parts  taste oh shit now were about to get heavenly up in here this is why sometimes you ignore that drink fresh notion fresh maple dominates seeming too sweet sometimes fresh coffee just dominates and that is largely all you taste but here 4 years later you get this full fledged bourbon accentuated with maple and coffee again the notion of equal parts but it tastes even better than it smells of course the damn mouth feel is silky and luxurious the maple seems to be best here smoothing out double digit abv into a delight to drink never oppressive hot bitter etc    shit man this beer is a prime example of how a barrel aged stout w some adjuncts can get even better with age,0.544959845599078,0.9768
1932,Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,if citra is your thing this is where you want to be super juicy an awesome example of this hops flavor highlighting it with a nice medium level of mouthfeel the head is not overly eager and fades fairly quick to a ring around the edge of the glass this is much smoother than the regular gitm and an improvement on that beer in every way,0.5449363613770095,0.9184
4810,Matt,12oz bottle from 2019 into a snifter  l almost still with just a collar of fine tan bubbles adorning the top of a clear deep russet body there isnt much foam and it doesnt leave any lace but the collar persists and keeps it from looking lifeless i think thats what was intended  s chocolate fruit smoke in that order the chocolate is semisweet like chips perfectly melted into warm cookies the fruit is quite bright and wavers between applepear and citrus cherrywood smoke rounds things out it smells simultaneously old and lively complex and focused really special  t everything from the nose comes through plus added notes of tobacco parchment and spice layer upon layer all rich with a consummately oldschool aesthetic that i havent encountered in a beer this fresh in years the finish is tingly with alcohol but hardly overbearing so so good  f soft mediumfull body with extremely delicate carbonation not quite as rich as the flavors could support but solid for sure  o wow this is the best beer ive had in a long time and is probably the best strong ale ive ever had it typifies that style for me as it does everything most barleywines do and then some so complex so layered so wellstructured magnificent beer  cheers,0.5449163950832664,0.9981
2793,The Peach,one of the beers i have been after for a long time has finally become a reality definitely one i have been keen on so cool to have beery friends out there this is unique in that its not just a peach wild ale but one aged in cognac barrels really complex and good its got a high shine and a pale color bright but less than fully clear through most of the bottle some little bubbles coming up but somewhat unremarkable visually it smells a bit more sour than a lot of the de garde beers have been in my experience so far really piquant slight vinegar character white wine acidity clean though less funky and i get the cognac immediately some sweetness and some alcohol warmth to it with the very natural peach its almost a baked dessert complexion light vanilla and graham and even tobacco to it nice complexity but very sour it seems the peach is crazy juicy and real and ripe very authentic here and i knew it would be based on the other fruit beers ive had in the past from these guys man i wish i had a reliable supply of their stuff the flavor here is excellent again more sour than expected but its a clean and lightly citrusy sourness it seems built to balance the sweetness of the peach and even highlight its essence the peach is bold from beginning to end here the wood is strong but the beer itself is quite light minimal on the grain side the peach really leads the way the cognac though is an amazing tough and im not sure this would be anywhere near as exciting without it despite the obvious quality its nutty and deeper than the oak alone a golden raisin hint maybe a sweet alcoholic layer even cigar or something in the mix just crazy its amazing with the peach i get a little less of the de garde funk that i like so much more generic acidity so i would enjoy more funkiness but i cant complain this was awesome overall different awesome than expected but great and really distinct with this combination of fruit and barrel i hate to admit i had a little sinus thing going on and may have not experienced this in its full glory as a result cant control those things and certainly wasnt going to pass on it so i will look forward to hopefully having this again i love this brewery its always a joy to drink their beers this appears worthy of its hype,0.5449078934310914,0.9991
6121,Caffè Americano,lifted this 22 oz bottle from a beer museum in river falls wi  im sure it has no idea how it got there split with my wife  black nose much milder than expected a bit of roast  sweetness little else  caffe americano is a boozy punch to the forebrain more balanced than most cc stouts this has equal portions of vanilla roast espresso sweetness all with a sturdy shot of alcohol  a finish of light chocolate big brawny no problem at all to put away half of this bottle  not quite up to the valhallahigh standards of cc but this is a stout that i would never be unhappy to find in a glass or doing keg stands with very good beer,0.5448883197700287,0.9219

5137,Clare's Thirsty Ale,im not generally one for fruited stouts  adjuncts in stouts should be restricted to vanilla cinnamon coffee nuts and whatever that isnt a fruit but clares thirsty ale was on the top 250 for years so i had to try it  usually berry adjuncts come across as medicinal to me except in sours  but this seems to be something of an exception the raspberry is pungently present in the nose but somehow does not have either a syrupy or astringent presence in the taste notes or mouth feel theres also very low acidity to the berry which is impressive  raspberry almost always imparts just a bit of acidity not so here which is nice the beer is fairly creamy in mouth feel with loads of chocolate and is quite smooth no small feat for such a high abv theres definitely heat to the beer  i drank this on an empty stomach and found myself stumbling a bit oops still not booze to the taste just a bit of heat in the chest  i see exactly why this beer is so respected i think i actually prefer it over jam the radar particularly as regards format pretty impressive  thank you to franfab who provided me with this can in the newbies winter blues bif,0.5447927165950018,0.9757

3089,Parabajava,2016 vintage on draft  fw beers always look more like a porter than a stout i tend to like the base beer more than this variant but this is nothing to scoff at a very tasty brew indeed,0.544641268929101,0.4582
1493,Lou Pepe - Framboise,2015 vintage tart raspberries with typical funk had the 2012 kriek and the 2013 side by side the kriek was a touch superior followed closely by the framboise,0.5446290903573836,0.5423
5871,Omega Point,omega point tasted like a subdued version of a malted chocolate covered raisin with a muted barrel presence poking through toward the end  overall nowhere near some of the better barleywines out there but for the price that i paid free it was enjoyable,0.5446271657494142,0.9001
370,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,32oz growler courtesy of lopo87 thanks small 3 oz pour  a thick as motor oil no head legs on the glass like the lamp from a christmas story  n intense caramel cotton candy brown sugar coffee fudge this is mostly sugar though hence the score  t good god diabetes cinnamon chocolate coffee a little bit of soy sauce a very slight pepper lots of dark fruits alcohol is well hidden pretty much the epitome of throw everything into the kettle  m heaviest beer ive ever tried a little bit of carbonation expands and contracts all over my palate  o theres almost no apple brandy so deducting some points there honestly this is amazing and then its way too much i compared it to the way nibbler must feel in futurama as well as making the mitch hedberg joke that its like pancakes when it starts its amazing by the time youre done youre sick of it,0.5446254054295036,0.9796
2631,Last Buffalo In The Park,pouring this from a 22 oz bottle into a snulip glass this beer pours out like a dark brewed coffee with little wood like highlights running throughout it forms a thin crown of bubbles that are khaki in color and dissipate quickly 375  the nose carries a stinging bourbon before even putting my nose to it putting my nose into it brings it with a more toned definition there is freshly cut coconut mixing with brown sugar and that warming bourbon with a kiss of dark fruit they achieved a very natural coconut no suntan lotion smell 475  the taste brings in the brown sugar just tangling with freshly toasted coconut all the way through slight milk chocolate but just as an accent its almost like a coconut pie drizzled with some chocolate the bourbon is there with some dark fruit accents but they didnt let this stray too far away from what the base is 45  the mouthfeel is smooth and doesnt have a bourbon burn to it just a nice balanced warmness to let you know its there along with a dryness from the barrels i would call it medium bodied 45  overall this didnt stray far from the base at all despite the almost double abv but did add a new dimension to it with a few nice layers after having this and morning wood last week it makes me wonder how long they age these in barrels i would guess minimal aging 35 months just because the way they are more accenting than anything which isnt a bad thing to me but just doesnt morph the beer like youd guess 45,0.5445962655934818,0.974
4584,Stickee Monkee,2017 vintage no 004 consumed jan 2 2021 pours a rich medium mahogany with maybe a 12 finger of fastdissipating foam no real lacing i have a bad sense of smell but i picked up raisins bourbon barrel oak maybe some other dark fruits wife got coconut same taste i really like this a lot but on a cost per ounce basis im not sure if it compares favorably at 083ounce with other bourbon barrelaged beers i really like as much or nearly as much,0.5445275106802377,0.8012
154,Mornin' Delight,nose is of course clearly maple all bait the beer itself is highly coffee dominateddriven to a somewhat surprising level i must say a superb stout,0.5445030295386565,0.8522
2226,Triple Shot,tons of coffee as expected get a little dark chocolate but the coffee really takes over great mouthfeel as most th stouts have the only negative is there was a sugary after taste that wasnt pleasant i prefer double shot over this one,0.5444734050549127,-0.3731
2066,Flora Plum,after flora pear this is my favorite flora excellent barrel character has been imparted into the beer pours a beautiful deep gold big wine nose effervescent with plums dancing in the background fantastic,0.5444647616582396,0.9349
2549,Beyond Good And Evil,wow just incredible  pitch black darkest of nights disclaimer that im a cologne man and a touch may be creeping into the nose but i pick up honeysuckle maple chocolate toffee almond fig black coffee  taste follows nose very well  motor oil thick very viscous love it  incredible barrel stout that blows many a mainstay out of the water  i was fortunate to be in vt for work but to not have to plan and hunt for such a beer was a real treat,0.5444614650935466,0.9654
153,Mornin' Delight,p deep brownish black with a slight brown head which dissipates stayed a bit stronger in the draft bergson  a strong maple syrup goodness with french toast draft was pure french toast  t sweet maple syrup up front followed by a strong roasted coffee and then gets more mapley on the back end the coffee was a bit lost in the draft version but i did not miss it  m nothing bad nothing great  o this is definitely a quality beer its pushing to be overly sweet but the coffee works to balance it well this definitely would be superb in a barrel,0.5444408901882059,0.9886
6221,Second Fiddle,look fairly clear but not totally gold with a very slight lean toward amber  smell slight sweetness with some tropical notes  mouthfeel medium body  taste tropical hop richness perhaps less full than zero gravitys madonna with a grassy pretty bitter finish  overall at the end of the day this one leans a bit to bitter for me  its wellmade but not really my thing reminds me of the plethora of ipas from 510 years ago all trying to out bitter each other  i enjoyed it for what it was as the 82 most definitely hit my head hard but wouldnt seek it out in the future,0.5444364819781432,0.9001
4281,DFPF,this beer is one which truly lives up to the hype at times beers like this gain a cultlike following without having the commensurate quality but here that is far from the case  the taste exudes the balanced fruits and the mouthfeel is thicker than the beer itself but not too thick where it becomes overwhelming or chewy it is still thin and refreshing i have had this on draft in bottles 19 and 20 releases and have loved every sip of it it is wellblended and balanced and a refreshing and enjoyable combination of tartness and fruitiness  i love this beer,0.5444338243468532,0.969
3380,Moment Of Clarity,i really dont get the hype behind this beer this is big and sweet with a small tan head even after the hard pour into my gold th teku smell is sweet and maple dont get a whole lot of roast or coffee flavor follows with the sweetness after it warms up i feel like it became a bit more bitter and bakers chocolaty definitely more dynamic i think this is a pretty good beer but not worth any of the hype around a 100 score on ba id much rather drink their ipas,0.5444088605656455,0.8402
1998,Resolute - Coconut,latest batch 2015 i believe drank in a snifter on 10152016  amotor oil thick thin head  ssome sweet coconut is present but subtle and mellow the bourbon barrel and chocolate are really potent  tlovely smooth bourbon barrel with its oak and sweet tasty chocolate are really the big hitters there is some vanilla present and the sweet coconut is there but nothing overpowering not terribly overly complex but just an amazing combination of flavors and the flavors themselves are some of the best i have tasted  fthick creamy coats the mouth minimal booze really amazing  othis was an extremely well done beer i was excited for this but this exceeded my expectations and by a lot one of the best beers i have had the barrel came through exceptionally well in this making the balance of all the other flavors just extraordinary i did not get the whole mounds bar take like it sounds like a lot of people have which maybe is due to a little age on the bottle nevertheless i think that worked in my favor amazing and i will seek out more from the resolute series,0.5443340312648397,0.9959
2492,Bourbon Paradise,bba imperial 137 abv stout featuring vanilla and coconut  nothing wrong here but its an unexceptional take on the style  that said yes  you get bourbon you get vanilla and you get coconut too  highabv stout body with appropriate chocolatiness and coffee  maybe im just jaded  this 12 oz bottle was 999 iirc  prairie being notoriously highpriced right lol  so in sum you get what they advertise but to my tastes it doesnt do anything with the ingredients that elevates it above peer drinks or to justify the price fans of vanilla and coconut bba stouts will absolutely dig this though,0.5442768179599106,0.7922
4598,Stickee Monkee,served in a tulip glass from a vintage 2017 bottle  appearance very dark amber coming off with an off white head  smell heavy whiskey feel which disintegrates into your nostrils and stick with you for a while  taste super complex consisting of toffee honey whiskey and a light dose of yeast  mouth suave carbonation but extremely sticky with a full body the taste just lingers with you at the place in the glass down  overall i picked this up probably a yearandahalf ago and i cannot remember where but it is an absolute must grab if you ever see it on a shelf salud,0.5442373520889195,0.5346
2934,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,2013 bottle now aged 4 years  for the first time im appreciating oxidation in a beer it certainly is but im strangely not put off by it the coffee in its original form is long gone but a shell of where it was remains with outlier elements of char roast and pepper  there is still a large amount of sweetness and barrel in this beer loads of vanilla carmelized sugar toffee brown sugar and bourbon  its leaves you dry spicy and satisfied  overall its a shame i didnt get to try this fresh but even with such age its entirely evident what a carefully crafted top tier beer this is,0.5442327815334332,0.9192
1207,Framboise Du Fermier,pale salmonamber with almost no head that builds resulting in a thin ring around the edge  not intending to start this off exactly like another review a few lines down but this b2 fdf is way too sour its almost vinegary an acetic blackened oak overpowers the seedy raspberry which is not as present as id expected the finely carbonated medium body has also got a lemon juice sting to the dry finish  definitely a huge disappointment particularly considering its position on the top 250,0.544212472750955,0.5494
4672,Adam From The Wood,2015 vintage bourbon drank on 12262016 no head whatsoever similar to the other hotds which i always find enjoyable boozy caramelly bourbon on the smell and nose not super thick but definitely right on point for an old ale very well done beer here that i am happy to have finally gotten to enjoy,0.5439970860828579,0.9457
1089,Double Citra®,more orange than golden pour creamy bright white head and the smell pop the top and its like someone in the room just sliced a grapefruit we know were dealing with a single hop beer and the taste while consistent and one note still takes you on a journey the citra comes through loud and clear and then at a point in the midtaste that taste kind of ramps up to a new level and lets not forget that long luxurious aftertaste brilliantly crafted,0.5439945402404207,0.9255
751,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,great beer with a stellar coffee profile look and mouthfeel leave a bit to be desired but the beer makes up for it with a coffeeforward nose and flavor that is superior to the majority of beers in this style the barrel comes through as well,0.5439531134496162,0.886
4154,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,loved the complexity of this beer look was quite bubbly and minorly cloudy aroma and taste had a great deal of complexity and funkiness i did enjoy the vastness of this beer in contrast to the great but simple oude gueuze would definitely pursue this beer again not easy to find,0.543946642491719,0.8439
188,King Julius,an amazing hazy new england ipa like one know that tree house can do extremely fruity with a nice easygoing better twist to it the real juice for sure,0.5438919773570239,0.9393

2571,The Rusty Nail,bottle date 2020 palate contaminants too much sushi and sake  really dark brown that doesnt let any light in even on the way from the bottle to the glass this thing just looks thick theres a good amount of very fine dark brown head no lacing points for putting a few twists on a standard look  the main scent is cinnamon toast crunch theres the sugary cinnamon and moderate toasted grain and lots of it theres also a bit of clove honey in there the scent is detectable at good strength for a while usually its goes away after a minute  the scent is present in the taste and about at the same intensity theres also a dark molasses that carries a lot of other flavors smoky prunes yellow raisins and medjool dates its sneaky sweet has lightmoderate bitterness and its savory in its own way what gets this ohsoclose to a 5 on taste is the intensity i dont have to search for anything the only knock is the smoke of the molasses carries a bit of acrid taste with it  the scent and taste hand around at the same level for so long thats a straightup accomplishment for any consumable alcohol is present but it plays pretty nicely with the other things its got a very nice heavy weight without coming across as syrupy but i also had a really heavy flavorful meal so maybe its about the competition the gout begins in 3 2 very fine carbonation is incredibly well integrated and it takes a vigorous swish to get it out yet theres plenty  this brew is just amazing im wondering if my second yet to be acquired bottle could possibly be as good i mean i really want to find out,0.543800820538526,0.9884
5894,Vicinity,this is a great neipa departs from some of the standards but is still a great beer i appreciate the level of bitterness as it balances the immense pineapple and papaya that the hops give off,0.5437796985399712,0.8481
2386,Miami Madness,basically straight fruit juice with the low abv on this it should honestly be packaged in fruit juice boxes like hic instead of bottles i enjoyed it for what it was but i like my beer to at least register some level of abv,0.5437540246231004,0.7935
608,Bourbon County Brand Stout,well theres a lot of hype surrounding this beer big brew that sold out to anheuser busch but people still flock to get it the original bourbon barrel aged stout that so many others have copied i finally found it in a local shop ive never been in before and they had six on the shelf 15 i am drinking the regular flagship 2020 vintage so the bottle isnt very old poured out into a snifter as suggested a deep dark brown with very little head retention smell is absolutely delectable one of the best smelling beers ive experienced its very richly bourbon sugary maple syrup and molasses just wonderful really makes me want to drink it so i do and its fanfuckingtastic rich fudge maple chocolate vanilla smoked out leather and a huge chord of warming bourbon that fills the mouth a good half minute after swallowing and mouthfeel is thick and juicy moderate carbonation overall im impressed and i love big stouts like this so ive had a fair number to compare it to this brew is like an old rich guys high backed leather chair sitting in front of the fire wearing an ascot and smoking a fine cigar kind of delicious ill definitely be returning to this again for special occasions,0.543490746147986,0.9976

5122,Citraquench'l,i unfortunately cant get down with 100 citra ipas much anymore with the exception of double citra from hf  drool  the overpowering qualities of cat pee dominate here good to try though and a great body for what it is,0.5433709714764545,0.6249
5053,Coffee Abraxas,outstanding imperial stout thick motor oil pour and feel coffee is heavy on the nose and similarly is the most present of the adjuncts it feels more like its own beer than an abraxas variant as most of the cinnamon and pepper is subdued by the coffee not a bad thing just different than what i expected,0.5433540957422758,0.8845
2541,Beyond Good And Evil,2018 version poured from the bottle into a snifter i find this tremendously tasty the viscosity coats the glass nicely wonderful maple flavor without being over the toptoo sweet,0.5433201996695738,0.8625
6174,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,bourbon barrel black maple pours a very deep brown and sports a light brown head of foam the head dissipates fairly quickly the beer smells quite good  its certainly sweet per the nose but also has a bit of booziness  while cold the beer has a slightly dry mouth feel the barrel is definitely present it is per the smell very sweet the maple somehow fails to be all that present in the taste  as the beer warms it just gets sweeter it has a nice bit of heat to it but the alcohol isnt present in the taste  as with cbs  id expected more of this beer i like maple in general and as an adjunct so the last few maple beers have let me down a bit great notions double stack has been the only one to really impress me thus far wish it was easier to get,0.5433140313428271,0.9891
7,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,the look is great and then its downhill after that this beer has so much coffee and sweet flavors that i cannot taste the stoutthe beer aspect of it it needs to be in another new category because as a stout beer it really just isnt other than maybe its color now if those coffee maple bourbon et al flavors came from the malt or wood then bravo but they didnt,0.5432597605612761,0.5994

5744,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),pour is jet black thick tan head aromas are led by the barrel but the dark chocolate aromas are present as is the honey  the taste has the dark chocolate evolving to a rich cocoa flavor which may be the combination of the dark chocolate flavors and the honey whatever it is i absolutely love it theres also a boozy burn present but its well onto the back of the palate and isnt overwhelming in any way  i wish id purchased three bombers of this because it is exceptionally well executed,0.5429502726841539,0.9699
4441,Hold On To Sunshine,we opened this can last night with temps in the 60s the kids tending to the fire pit and the air crisp we threw around some slices with ipas earlier then settled next to the fire to roast marshmallows and sip this stout it poured a dark wood charcoal color with hints of amber around the edges the head made a brief presence then ebbed away the aroma wafts out of the tulip glass with delectable coffee and chocolate notes pass just the marshmallows please i have all the chocolate i need the stout swirls deliciously and the milky sweetness combines with the carbonation to give it an ice cream float profile to the taste when treehouse says coffee they mean it what a treat,0.5429348609271217,0.9149
104,Heady Topper,i live in vt and buy a pack of these every couple months most recent was canned ten days before consumption yesterday and tonight  about as good as beer gets truthfully heady varies a bit year to year but this years have been excellent maybe its just me wanting a strong brew after a troubling times maybe not  thick hoppy dank and catty flavors are almost overwhelming but ever so balanced by some magical blend of juicy citrus and malty notes some will say its too bitter but i find it smoother and more drinkable than most beers of this style many similar beers are too sweet or astringent and unpleasant on the throat as they warm heady is exemplary because it can be smooth and almost refreshing while socking you on the chin with hops  i am biased  this beer has a place in my heart i love to try new things especially beer and am lucky to live in a place where i can get lots of tasty drinks that said i keep coming back to the alchemist not an everyday beer for me but easily world class and a something you can feel good about buying,0.5428884757871101,0.9813
2943,Coconut Vibes,easily my favorite nonba coconut stout its basically coconut candy in a well done base stout the coconut aroma stops you in your tracks mouth feel is on the thicker side for a nonba gets better as it warms easy 55,0.5428589491258925,0.9349
4479,Leaner,this might be the first sour worthy of a 5 the signature mouthfeel of casey with that acidity of side project this peach explosion is sheer perfection,0.5428176831429649,0.765
2381,Miami Madness,now were talking poured this and honestly thought it was a hazy ne ipa absolutely beautiful to look at starburst orange color that just pops aroma is unrealguava mango and passion fruit galore taste is exactly as the noseall the fruits plus a side of tartness please feel was spot ondry yet refreshing could drink this all day overall this is the best berliner ive ever tasted,0.542807396993183,0.9493
5740,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),pours an opaque brownish black color with quickly dissipating tan head and fair amount of residual lacingnose is very mild chocolate sweetness a bit of bourbon barrel and a touch of honey taste follows nose feels a bit on the thin side not quite a disappointment but not the best value definitely a one and done mainly due to costthere are a whole lotta ba stouts out there for way less  that easily give this a run for the moneydont get me wrong this is veryvery good just way over priced,0.5427672506483694,0.3944
2692,Notorious Triple IPA,old school big ipa doesnt fall into the trappings of being a syrupy mess because of the high abv dry bitter resinous scary easy to drink well crafted i had very few tipas that i like love this one,0.5427040114403665,0.4939
1405,Supplication,bottled 072117 i was expecting the cork to pop it didnt the pour is very dark light head that doesnt last you can smell the pinot and cherries none of the flavors are dominant really nice balance between the tart and the residual wine aspects and just the right amount of funk i need to try a newer bottle for comparison  overall a wonderful ale,0.5425056739013673,0.7778
2015,Resolute - Coconut,may be the best nose ive ever smelled on a stout boozy with lots of coconut thick in the mouth with some heat i almost wish i had aged a little but this is delicious as is,0.5424739000115526,0.8659
4863,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,thanks to james for trading that magnum bart to score all these cigar city beers and hunahpu variants will return the favor  pours black brown head cola in appearance 12 deep retention aint too shabby the aroma is a hot stinging dose of alcohol first then roasted malt chile pepper wet oak cinammon there is a lot going on in the nose i seriously think i sniffed it 4 times in the first 60 seconds because each time it revealed more about the beer thankfully we cracked this one a little more leaning to the room temperature side of things  the taste like the aroma came through as hot on the first sip there was also a substantial amount of bitterness this thing seemed to be clocking in around the 90 ibu range tons of roasted barley in here and i guess a decent degree of hopping to get it into that range there isnt the smoothness of a vanilla factor here and the cacao nibs similarly get swallowed up by more domineering parts of this beer previous iterations seemed to have more pepper heat but i dunno theres heat here in multiple ways the alcohol first then the pepper each contributing to the overall burn and bitterness  plenty of viscosity in the mouthfeel ccb makes some thick ass stouts its real good but definitely a beer you need to share it just isnt something i can dome solo even though i absolutely enjoy it in small quantities,0.5423587273878416,0.8831
2367,Miami Madness,this is the best berliner ive ever tasted although this is coming from someone who doesnt really love berliners bright color and outstanding fruit flavor the guava really shines through the best part is the finish though its perfect not too sweet not too sour not too dry just perfect,0.5423071761954225,0.9578
3132,Framboos,different label than the one pictured here the double label looks nice lighter pink than expected and lighter in color than hommage 2018 vintage short head nice clarity and a ton of fruit in the nose i think the cherry in the hommage adds more than it immediately gets credit for as this seems in some ways one dimensional not a critique necessarily as its really pure and ripe and beautiful raspberry but there is less complexity there the fermentation profile is awesome a little younger lambic base but its perfect with the fruit its cool to still be able to taste and appreciate the grain in this lots of oak rose wine and flowers lemons and minerals i think it tastes slightly less dramatic than it smells a little sulfur and then the fruit red wine and lots of oak mature but cleaner than some of their others i have had maybe because its so new but its tidy and fast to finish even with all the raspberries their base lambic always stands out to me as one of the best and the fruit really works well here id like to try this a little more bottle aged but i sure did enjoy this one nice with chocolate and cakey dessert,0.5422327451887125,0.9951
1797,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,pours straw gold half inch head the hops come right at you and for me its a bit too forward the aroma is fantastic up there with the best strong notes of refreshing fruits citrus apple apple is a good one to hang on theres a crispness to the beer the slight distraction for me is the finish it coats the back of my tongue with a slight pithiness,0.5421467768360453,0.9134
2149,A Deal With The Devil,ill begin this review by stating that i am not a barleywine guy revoke my membership to bil because im not worthy  but jesus if you dont like this beer your craft is life membership should be revoked  a deal with the devil double oak has a strong caramel nose  tasting notes include rich caramel quite a lot of barrel a bit of malt chocolate notes and a lot of richness its quite sweet but with the balance of the barrels its very drinkable and finishes quite cleanly  again im no barleywine fan boy  but a deal with the devil is fantastic,0.5420929482090265,0.3135
5466,Coconut B-Bomb,for a stout i think pitch black for a winter ale i think brick red this one clearly looks like a stout which is ok it just doesnt look like id thought it hoped for still the obsidian body is beautiful the khaki foam above is minimal and it has a swagger about it coating the glass with each swirl  the aroma also leans more on the stout side if the fence but that just may be our accustomed nature as of late to associating boozy barrel to big stouts their is however plenty of toasted bread and burnt brown sugar to defend the winter warmer namesake the coconut would be completely overlooked or i guess i should say unnoticed if it werent for the advertisement on the bottle  similarly this continues the theme of stout chocolate caramel and brown sugar are met with fig black cherries and sure lets go with toasted coconut oak creeps up in the finish along with a well established alcohol and indistinguishable blend of spices a graham cracker base only intensifies as it warms  now the hard part its sappy sticky rich and smooth boozy warming sweet and spicy toasty roasty fruity and bold if i rate as a delicious beer with a wonderful texture this hits the marks if i label it as a winter ale this lacks the cleanliness and bitterness it so desperately needs  as i browse through others reviews before my own ive noticed a common sense of confusion in style this unlike original b bombs ive had in the past has mistaken itself for a stout while it is without a doubt delicious and well made in all accounts its not a winter ale unless weve just changed the prerequisites with this offering regardless of what it is or is not get one if you can its wonderful  cheers,0.5420700241549484,0.9944

4793,Leche Borracho,on tap at the source 2018 edition l pitch black in appearance a tiny head that retained a tight khaki ring around the perimeter of glass actually get a little bit of lacing on the glass which is commendable s aromas of cinnamon bourbon chocolate dates molasses nutmeg and subtle milk sugar sweetness great smelling and not boozy tman this is unique the thing that stands out to me is it is so flavorful even when cold tons of chocolate and cinnamon up front the pepper spice is noticeable but it inst overly done just perfectly implemented on the finish the lactose is prevalent as well giving a milk complexity to the flavor reminding me of horchata the tequila barrel is present on the initial profile but the finish is all bourbon fantastic f full in body medium to heavy in weight nice smooth feel with decent heft o an incredible offering from bl i am super glad to try it on tap and cant wait to see how it fares from the bottle i am very glad to have tired for the record the wife approves of this beer which is saying something as she isnt a stout drinker cheers,0.5420023390572501,0.9937
3136,Framboos,2014 bottle poured into a bulb beautiful colordeep ruby red smells of funky raspberry jam taste isnt as expected as i was expecting more fruit theres fruit there just not as jammy as i had hoped still outstanding though feel is nice what youd expect for this style overall excellent beer so happy i got to try thanks ray for sharing,0.5419879414517752,0.9783
3011,Wide Awake It's Morning,mostly maple with some coffee has a metallic flavor to it reminds of waffle crisp cereal you know its not too bad but leaves an after taste that seems really fake maple did not enjoy this very much prefer hipster brunch by quite a bit for a beer with these adjuncts finished half the bottle and then went on to something else,0.541979323504717,-0.7968
5712,Fort Point Pale Ale,swung by trillium on the way through boston grabbed a 4 pack of these along with some other goodies can dated 6519 and poured into a tulip glass  l deep wheatorange with a good 2 inches of froth that sticks around for a little bit but quickly fades  s deep mango richness  tropical bubble gum and some citrus zest quite aromatic  you can smell the beer after you pour almost a bit of peach  t to me the taste doesnt necessarily follow the nose of this beer i taste lots of rind some pine and a bit of zip that isnt exactly peppery but something to that effect a bit of an alcohol burntaste that is a little unusual  perhaps a unique batch  f another review mentioned effervescent and that is a great description along with the high level of carbonation its pretty zesty  o a nice apa although it definitely reminds me more of a ne ipa great aroma but i didnt find this as easy to drink as many of the other great ne ipas out there these days im sure that trillium has several others that are stronger than this offering,0.5419662845805681,0.9939
3610,Darkness,ive been waiting a long time for a chance at darkness i finally picked up a bottle this summer in durango colorado of all places i suppose i could sit on it for a while but it seemed like the perfect beer for a dark december night in rainy seattle  its dark oh yeah theres a good tan head but it doesnt last long the tastesmell are notable first for whats not there theres no bourbon no chocolate no coconut in fact theres no sweetness at all in an era of tarted up over sweet stouts hello cbs darkness is refreshingly basic  its a very fine mix of roasted malts and hops now the roasted malts do have some dry cocoa flavor but this is not like drinking a hershey bar i get dark fruits raisins sort of but again its not sweet theres a hefty dose of hops that give the beer a kick the 12 abv is somehow hidden  i had the 2018 vintage by the way this does remind me of old rasputin,0.5419271540613273,0.9461

1381,Aaron,4 oz onsite 2015 aaron  nice deep maplesyrup color in the glass small ring of foam clings where the liquid meets the edge of the glass  nose isnt huge but im getting primarily caramelburnt sugar dark stone fruits something resembling maple syrup but couldnt find the bourbon  each sip starts with toffee rock candy sweet syrup ending on something i wanna say is almost like black tea with a little smidge of alcohol to cut through the sweetness again to my surprise not much in the way of bourbon but i honestly think it was better for that  little carb sticky and coats the tongue but nothing big or overwhelming and sweetness is always pleasant and never cloying  overall cant think of a single better barleywine ive had held in especially high contrast against a very bittermedicinalcough syrupy barleywine id picked up from a bottle shop the day before finishing this pour only renewed my efforts to try to land a bottle definitely dont pass this one up if one comes your way,0.541828962362108,0.9895

79,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,february 5th side by side tasking with regular 2018 abraxas low carbonation a little barrel and pepper heat decent thickness for me this is better than non ba but only marginally,0.5417901060295994,0.1027
2005,Resolute - Coconut,this is a perfect ba coconut stout incredible coconut nose something thats difficult to achieve and far exceeded all other ba coconut stouts on that front complete almond joy coconut bomb on the flavor but more natural beautiful thick mouth feel id have a hard time choosing between this and prop 13,0.5417699073476359,0.9023
4142,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,this has been a beer ive wanted to get into for a really long time i know it changes from blend to blend but i was able to have the 2017 vintage that has some honey in it recently i believe the first time golden blend has contained honey and there is a cute little bee on the label to designate this vintage still comprised of 25 4 year lambic its incredibly effervescent in the glass to my surprise fizzy like a soda and even has some lemon and lime soda aromatics to it i get the floral polleny raw honey element in the nose as well not sweet but obviously and distinctively honey to me with a very mature lambic character wheaty more puckery than some others i have had from these guys and with a great musty danky funk to it as well bright and woody at the same time musty and fresh at the same time earthy and clean at the same time its crazy stuff for how little honey is actually in here i am surprised how well i can taste it through the layers of various lambics in this blend i get a nice acidic pop up front and at the end with a more wheaty malty middle and some decaying oak vanilla orange zest green apple champagne and wet grass in the morning the integration of the different vintages is awesome and the sort of concentrated funkiness from the old lambic is really evident this really is an amazing expression of their fermentation profile more distinctive here than in any other of their beers i have had i know this one is pretty new but i love what the honey does to it it makes me that much more excited to open the super old one that exists in my cellar,0.5417422794924656,0.997
3012,Wide Awake It's Morning,its been awhile since i experienced mbcp so was really excited to try this one it does not disappoint  smells like pure maple syrup with just a hint of coffee was worried the maple may be over powering but the balance is just about perfect maple is present but not too sweet the smokey roasty quality balances it out nicely  would definitely seek this out again,0.5415553426038694,0.8929
2870,Pirate Bomb!,on tap  this is the july 2019 batch so 15 months old  pours jet black with a super thin tan head around the circumference of the glass no lacing  smell is rum and chocolate upfront with coffee kicking in just a little bit after the booze is strong on the nose but a bit of vanilla is there to balance it  taste follows the nose the booze sting is minimal considering the abv good balance between the sweet vanilla chocolate and coffee the spices and coffee combine for an earthy finish that doesnt last longer than it should  feel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation it doesnt stick much or leave a thick residue on the tongue which for me sets it apart a bit from other prairie stouts  overall quite good i had a tough time assigning numbers to this one so i looked back through my previous ratings on various stouts and eventually decided that i had to give this one 425 straight through its not the best but far from the worst and very consistent across the board,0.5415476531384658,0.3793
5975,Smooth,this is the best beer that ive had from side project this one is named smooth since nectarines dont have peach fuzz and it is smooth drinking no chunks of fruit in this beer and it had nice clarity well carbonated and new co2 always kicked up when swirled in the glass tons of fruit and musty farmhousey goodness in the nose almost like moldy or old fruit in the smell but in the best way possible  the farmhouse was distinct from the fruit the taste is sour goodness farmhouse animal jamboree and fruit it is weird but you can actually taste that it is nectarines instead of peaches this is not as in your face sour like most of sp beers which i really liked would be easy to drink a few bottles by yourself,0.5415280095694116,0.9816

1220,Framboise Du Fermier,tasted this as part of a fruited fermier set the nose promised an acidic affair but was quite soft upon tasting this was my second favorite fruited fermier to the abricot a really nice beer but perhaps its rarity is driving up ratings a bit,0.541380244094525,0.8717
174,Mornin' Delight,on tap at vintage estate boardman ohio snifter pour  l  thick and chewy looking heavy amount of thick head disappointing looking carbonation very large bubbles as opposed to tight froth not a worth class high abv look at all  s  big big maple nice coffee cream lightly burnt sugar just loads of maple  t  definitely the most maple forward beer ive ever had by a country mile the coffee is dark and roasty the base of this beer is classic and roasty like an expedition stout and not overly sweet like a bcbs the maple starkly contrasts the roast and plays on the base nicely  f  is nice but not mind blowing  o  very great beer but not exactly leaps and bounds above a plethora of other beers that are similar  top 250 yeah number 10 nah i actually wound up with these 2 times in large beer trades but never drank them because i didnt believe theyd be worth the 100 in other beer i could trade them for i was not wrong i wouldnt pay more than 15 for this to drink if it were on the shelf,0.5413697575628172,0.9667
2277,Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,my youngest daughter gave me this for christmas and had been bugging me to not wait too long to drink it little does she know whats in my cellar so i was waiting for the weather to cool down and today is it  2019 poured into a dfh tulip brownish black body with a nice creamy head of tight bubbles with good retention smell is cinnamon upfront with not much coffee and deep roasty malts taste is big cinnamon with a bit of coffee and chocolate nicely complex can taste a bit of a booze burn when it warms but the balance on this is good enough that im not kicking myself for not aging this longer at least not too much mouthfeel is beautifully creamy and thats what really sets this off usually with a big dark bomb like this im all about it being chewy but creamy really works  just a fantastic experience thank you jenny wren,0.541360268528511,0.9719
906,Westly,foggy orange appearing slightly lighter around the edges with a short but persistent fuzzy blanket ridged at the collar with one long arm of lace reaching around half the glass  unexpectedly this features more wood and funk than fruit its quite mature nutty oaky and even dusty with notes of cashew and walnut at the same time its quite sour of white wine apricots green grape lemon and mango vinegar while at the same time avoiding acetic harshness the moderate body has a soft then crispening fizz before coming to a semidry finish  while i was slightly underwhelmed by west ashley this is a marked improvement and really in and of itself a fantastic saison however while qualifying ahead of time that sara has nothing to prove for a saison showcasing a stone fruit such as apricot it doesnt quite reach the heights of some of the greats fou foune is already a tall hill to overcome but even further for me personally de garde is the king of the stone fruits and just tower over everyone else,0.5412113838144369,0.9136
3040,Cable Car Kriek,look of murky ruby red small amount of head forms at the top smell is of vinous cherry smells excellent still taste is light acidity and funk with full blown cherry the feel is light and perfect amount of carbonation even after all these years it still has a lot of cherry hands down one of the best sours i have ever had the opportunity to drink would hunt it down again for sure,0.5411865364185163,0.9552
3508,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,this is hands down three or four times better than non barrel aged imperial biscotti break the bourbon adds a nice complexity that also dulls what i would call the fake flavors of regular biscotti break,0.5411733188320856,0.1531
6025,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,super sweetrum is prominent in the taste and noseget a little bit of chocolate on the back endbut the rum flavor is king herealcohol is well hidden on this beast of a stout,0.5411302916138664,0.8402
714,KBS,this beer sets my expectations for barrel aged stouts its all there the bourbon the wood the chocolate the coffee and the vanilla all mingle together wonderfully i love this beer and all its variations,0.5410989786521477,0.8442
3691,Congress Street IPA,a dark orange orange like a pumpkin in november a light hoppy citrus like the easter bunny on vacation in malibu t dry pithy orange juice with a dollop of alcohol  minute maid has nothing on this f beautifully soft like running your hands through princess jasmines hair  i really like this beer its not the best of the best but its damn solid for being a flagship,0.541086966251159,0.7061
598,Double Sunshine,copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering a third of the top the aroma is of of pine im tasting a wallop of pine and a touch of grassy hops the mouth is sticky and chewy,0.5410422244194897,0.2023
4146,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,file this review under really expensive beer that i hate because it is so delicious  pours a slightly darker color of gold than your average gueuze super thin 16 white head aroma is kicking down some seriously sour notes what is missing is that plastic burning feel that 3f had going on for awhile this is just tons of lemon like sour notes and oak mild funk behind it not harsh enjoyable  a taste that brings out citrus notes without relying too much on lemon and grapefruit solely very sour but not acidic really effortless drinking the notion of barnyard can only be discussed by saying it must be a very clean barnyard the farm butthole aspect of a gueuze isnt present thankfully i like this more than their regular gueuze because its aroma is better and it has more of a varied citrus flavor instead of just lemon sour power carbonation was on point interesting that the alcohol is 75 in this one compared to the normal gueuze cant taste it thankfully  downside of this beer is that it is expensive af but even then i could see spoiling myself every now and then and buying it again 30375ml but the score suffers because of the price if this was priced like de garde i would say its rating would be like 475,0.5410371561914039,0.9055
5919,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,beautiful beer light tart and refreshing perfect beer for a hot day drank this while floating in my pool all afternoon made my float more enjoyable,0.5410195142581724,0.8955
831,Lou Pepe - Kriek,very drinkable at 5 abv taste of multiple types of fruit very limited availability in the usa but for the high price would recommend other lambic beers as an alternative either way solid offering if you can get it,0.541019221188115,0.5504
3006,Wide Awake It's Morning,this thing is a beast even more packed with all of these awesome flavors than the maple bacon is but without the unifying and mellowing barrel elements of the morning wood big thanks to my homie for bringing this one over for maple beer night i had not ever seen it before but have loved its two sister beers its as thick and dense looking as it seems like it should be near black but a high luster and some nice thick foamy tan head it smells more like coffee than anything else seemingly higher in the proportionality than in the maple bacon a little less smoke and greasiness and all too and still with a high maple sweetness element there is a lot of nuance here too though like black pepper and fresh tobacco and molasses its as complex in the flavor too but we are all sort of stunned at how this isnt super insanely sweet i mean its still way more sugary than you could reasonably drink a whole bomber of but this is not over the top at all despite the maple flavor still being really potent in here nice almost burnt dark malt complexion to even it out and all the coffee really helps i didnt catch a bottle date but the coffee tastes pretty fresh in here to me and its intensity cuts some of the weight of the body and the sweetness i like its contribution a lot the bacon part of this is a little underwhelming less obvious in the mix than in the base beer light campfire smoke is all this isnt meaty or anything to me a really intense brew but as good as any of the wildly flavored stouts these guys do i dont think it needs the barrel i enjoyed this edition a lot and it was a great end to our epic maple beer night,0.5409673983407056,0.9959
2437,§ucaba,2016 vintage from 22 oz bottle 134 abv from quality liquor store out of san diego ca  beautiful and unique dirty amber color first served around 45 degrees f the beer just explodes with flavor smells similar to the best imperial stouts but immediately informs you it is in fact a barleywine upon first drink very lovely on the palate  blooming yellowbrown head that disappears almost entirely as quickly as it came  the booze greets you with every drink unyielding which is a good thing  think w00tstout aged in delicate wines and youre on your way to an idea of what its like  after warming the sharpness of the mouthfeel starts to subside a bit,0.54091932239517,0.9504
1763,Ephraim,expecting a bit more from this one i expected the booziness given the 10 abv but seem to be lacking in the aroma department i enjoyed abner earlier this week much more nonetheless this is still a great beer hf continues to produce high quality beers,0.5408415320503537,0.9022
537,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,dark black with a pretty thin tan head smell is pure vanilla and coconut taste is out of this world one of the best things ive ever tasted period coconut up front smoothing out into pure chocolate flavor that really does taste like german chocolate cake the only knock ill give it is that the barrel doesnt come through a ton in the flavor but its hard to call that a negative when it tastes this good pretty sweet but not painfully so smooth feel maybe id like it a little bit thicker but again  this is just quibbling and its hard to really knock this at all fantastic,0.5407838487031904,0.9723
3722,Double Stack,on draft at great notion  deep dark brown with a lacey ring of foam around the edge of glass aromas had some maple and coffee with chocolate and roasted malts but the depth of flavor was not there and certainly not to the level of something like mornin delight the maple seems artificial perhaps the thing that really didnt live up to expectation was the feel much lighter than expected,0.5407145694362336,0.8623
3461,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,excellent porter one of the best roasty complex bold super challenging to acquire but definitely worth the chase got to try high coast next to it too amazing combo,0.5406025830996573,0.9618
5527,Birth Of Tragedy,2016 bottle drank 072820 out of a tulip  just spectacular beautiful ring of brown head around the edges but not much more than that nice dark color smelled of mild bourbon and a 5050 mix of darklight stout for whatever that means taste was smooth and mild perfect mouthfeel thick and solid but not overly so just awesome the mildness was kind of different from what youd expect from a beer labeled as a porter  id call it a stout but doesnt really matter to me im sure the age accentuated the all around mildness and smooth feel cant wait to try this fresh to see what the differences are cheers,0.5405394399604656,0.987
5475,Coconut B-Bomb,2018 release from a bomber poured to a snifter very thick and opaque viscous when swirled with a full finger of fluffy homogeneous head quite coconutforward smart to toast it before adding in order to match better with the dark and bourbonforward notes of the base beer as always a gorgeous mouthfeel luxuriously smooth and silky on the tongue,0.5404901117783485,0.8714
1713,Green,thanks to rub_this_bbq for this one from a lif during the recent cancans bif 16oz can dated 7820 poured into 14oz teku poured fully murky as expected yellow color with well over an inch of white head that had very good retention and lacing  no maltgrain in the nose but some pine showed through and hints of tart citrus  on the tongue there was notably more bitterness than is typical for the style and low fruit flavors  the body was the expected light had a bit of sharpness across the tongue and a finish that was between dry and medium  drinkability was good the bitterness kept the beer interesting throughout  overall one of the better murkbombs ive had certainly worth trying if you see it,0.5404839300493627,0.8593
5331,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,man just too thick and syrupy for my taste felt like i had to take insulin after drinking this no way could i do more than 45 ounces lots of chocolate with some spices,0.540417553036522,0.0
923,Westly,a delicious beer indeed bright orange color pours with virtually no head juicy fresh apricot and hay nose bright stone fruit vinous juiciness with a funky tartness that just leans on the edge of sharpness in a vacuum this beer certainly stands on its own merits however i cant help but to weigh the vast difference in the cost of admission versus west ashleyfou as compared to the difference in quality which is in my humble opinion marginal,0.5403069779148971,0.7202
378,Assassin,i was lucky enough to win the recent assassin vertical random draw drove to iowa on friday pick up day was saturday i sampled 2020 assassin term oil and kaiju clash  look dark like a stout should be smell bourbon chocolate slight vanilla taste no adjuncts pure ba imperial stout picking up some vanilla on the back end feel thinner than i expected but still nice overall maybe the hype was too much the beer is very good but i was not blown away,0.540228223545543,0.9227
3535,Mocha Wednesday,2016 vintage  poured with quite a bit of sedimentfloatiesthis is a dangerous brew the alcohol is barely noticeable delicious brew and very chocolate forward only marks down was for the sediment wasnt expecting as much as there was,0.5402110522590133,0.0828
4828,Matt,all of the beers we had at hair of the dog were highlights so its hard to single out this 2008 matt as the standout but it was pretty darn impressive no idea what it tasted like fresh but some time in the bottle has really done it well one of the few beers i can think of that could stand up over time like this not a lick of oxidation or staleness in here at all just a smooth mellow well integrated brew all the way around rich syrupy viscous dark dark brown pour still with a little bubbling head on it notes of campfire black licorice cigar brandy raisin and dark chocolate all waft out from the glass slowly and patiently weaving a complex aromatic tapestry that is entirely unique burnt leather and bourbon come through the dark english or german malts rauch type smoke has mellowed some sticky bread pudding root beer then they apple grappa stuff in the finish man is this layered it doesnt quite have that roasted barley stout quality to it it doesnt go that deep but in its bitter absence there arises this space for other flavors usually lost to it and i think this lands perfectly in the middle of all of them i am amazed how this has done over time i expected more of a novelty at this age but that wasnt the case at all rich and velvety on the palate the warming alcohol seems necessary too brilliant beer what a treat,0.5401686406560858,0.9938
448,Juice Machine,pretty ridiculous creamy juicy smooth has an earthy nutty grassy taste i was not expecting for something called juice machine i was not blown away because you know i live in the northeast but certainly one of the best beers ive ever had,0.5399970220672463,0.882
458,Julius,i waited in line on memorial day for 45 minutes to pick up a case of this canned on 528 first impression quite good and very drinkable nice balance of hops and citrus i think i prefer the more bitter mouth feel of heady topper but this is a really great beer,0.5399291531386766,0.8634
1884,Haze,did the children have a good week in mantucket was it a long ferry and drive back was there too much going on unloading the car and getting the kids into bed and putting stuff away thanks haze solid straw gold look with a 14 head on a soft pour and 34 with a second hard pour in a tulip glass lacy foam coating the glass during the 2nd overtime dallas win nice citrus and sweet flavors coming through passion fruit or papaya the hops barely comes through and nicely controlled the aroma is ne dipa all the way citrus peachy papaya mango nice finish on the drier side double ipa you would never know it not boozy and immensely drinkable,0.5398306735596426,0.9729
1352,Rare Scooop,2016 batch drank in a snifter on 1292016  overall this was a really enjoyable beer the vanilla was potent and opened up more as it warmed overtaking the strawberry which was more prevalent when colder the combo with the chocolate was very nice the barrel was present but didnt overpower the neop flavors this was really enjoyable and im glad to try it one of the thicker cycle beers finally creamy as well well done,0.5398303938367146,0.9546
3846,Medianoche - Coconut,for all the hype around this and the others in the series this being my first of them i was a little let down by this as good as it is its awesome beer no doubt but seems almost big for the sake of being big less balanced than many of their others and frankly a little sloppy at the seams especially when it warms up a bit but thats being critical i suppose the beer is thick and deep brown long legs on the edges of the glass like a big cabernet not much head after the initial pour sweet sun tan sort of coconut to this pungent even above the huge dark malt base but with a surprising degree of toasted nuttiness and bitter roast on the back end there is a lot going on here but the coconut feels forced to me like it could be scaled back in a somewhat lesser beer its overly intense despite tasting great its less of a natural union than i had imagined some alcohol burn here though the residual sweetness which has an almost toffee flavor to it more than a suggestion of coffee bold vanilla and sticky caramel it could use a little more carbonation it drinks like blacktop sealant honestly its cool beer but for this variant anyway its overhyped and not as dialed as the rest of the weldwerks portfolio seems to be still amazing beer a must try for those who dont mind a little of the sweet fakey over the top coconut but it might be a better beer without that element,0.539395769694827,0.9924
3703,Congress Street IPA,columbus hop is biting right up front not a huge fan of this hop its creamy opposite beer for me dulled when it warmed up showed its single hopped  sheareness  very good another good one from trill need to try the dub version of this,0.5393802625741893,0.4647
334,Pliny The Elder,it is truly a beautiful rich and bright amber color in an eight ounce serving inside a clear glass theres a nice tight white head that seems to be perpetual despite the brightness and near translucenty this has some body look at the lacing inside the glass wow the aroma is of a good piney and biting hoppiness but its not overpowering the taste is just about west coast ipa perfect that means theres a solid but not sweet malt body cleanly carrying a poignant resinous yet dry bitter hop taste nothing out of whack delightful across the tongue rare is the beer better than this a necessary advisory this is from philadelphia three thousand miles away it certainly must taste even better on the other side of the country,0.5393457117594052,0.9793
5285,Bodhi,bottom of can is stamped 3121 i assume hope thats a bornedon date  massive stupid creamy head on this thing real nice lacing too honeyedorange body reminds me of twohearted and thats a definite plus all in all one of the prettier pours ive seen in a minute nice fresh hop scents resinous pine with a bit of citrus a lotta malt sweetness too smells nice taste follows but its a little muted hmmm maybe that was a bestby date i dont hate this by any stretch whats there is wellbalanced and tasty just doesnt taste fresh to me feel is soft and creamy slightly oily on the back end minimal carbonation and just a hair shy of mediumbodied crossed the border into ohio for cheaper gas the other day and found this in the cooler ill have to make that trip again some time and keep an eye out for fresh stock,0.5393236414671935,0.7966
1406,Supplication,smells wonderful its truly a fine belgium inspired brew that any fine monk would enjoy amazing how the taste of the pinot noir enhances the taste buds when i am usually adverse to wine alone just outstanding,0.5392859541005285,0.9633
3386,Moment Of Clarity,silky smoothyoud think it was a nitro pour but it wasnt big maple flavor throughout accompanied by chocolate and coffee in support almost jet black with a dark tan foamy head spectacular consistency from top of the glass to bottom a true dessert beer but why not start earlierin the morning with a stack of pancakes,0.5392702804651218,0.8573
3856,Medianoche - Coconut,poured from a first batch bottle into an avery rare beer snifter straight up coconut on the nose absolutely no trace of the promised 145 taste is coconut as well finally a coconut beer that delivers as it warms up the coconut gives way to the underlying barrel making for a wonderfully balanced barrelaged beer not too sweet but undeniably barrelaged at length only complaint is that it doesnt come in a 750ml format love it,0.5391736478962217,0.8054
5618,Space Trace,pours dark black with quickly dissipating head the aroma is bourbon chocolate and oak im not getting a ton of coconut its over powered by the chocolate huge chocolate flavors with a strong bourbon punch the coconut is there but it doesnt really come into play until the finish the mouthfeel isnt as thick as id like and its a bit over carbonated overall its very good but i dont think its worth what it pulls in a trade wait for bottle logics hype to die down before seeking this out,0.5390599612076131,0.7569
374,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,thanks bulbman for the hookup  look black with red circles around the top of the beer very little tan head and leaves the glass with a great coating  smell the nose of this beer like pretty much everything is just amazing there is so many layers to the nose i am not sure where to start the brandy really shines through with some dark chocolate brownies behind that traces of vanilla pass by the nose as well as a touch of chili peppers  taste holy fucking bananas batman this is amazing the beer has this wonderful chocolate covered cherry character brought forth by the brandy and right when you think the beer cant get any better it totally changes bringing forth lots of vanilla and fudge then a third wave takes over and you get a nice amount of chili pepper and molasses that just works perfectly together but wait theres more the beer finishes with that same chocolate covered cherry flavor  mouthfeel thick as hell and low to no carbonationcould be more oily as hell and you can just feel it coating your insides  overall this is the perfect dessert beer and is definitely in my top 3 beers of all time i am glad that another growler just arrived at my doorstep holy hell this beer is almost perfect and i honestly cant see a beer being much better,0.5390242623988839,0.9461
4256,Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),blindtasted except for the beers name and brewerycountry zero reviews below read yet l even restedchilled it forms head really fast so pour superslow pours deep chestnut brown with slight haze and a midtan 6cm head theres fast rising co2 microbubbles up the side of the nucleated glass ps holds well and forms major lacing on the way down s strikingly deeply toasty and rich malts it makes me imagine how a bag of ground up maltesers might smell t again very malty deep roasty a notably fat but classy abv note crosses my palate off into hops then further rich malts and into a hoppier somewhat dry finish solid yet refined blimey if you think this beers reputation is hype wait until you try it f rich deep roasty the abv is clear enough its similar to some liquor barrel aged beers o i picked this one for my 1950th review the westv12 will mark b2k i was conscious of the brewerys repute and hype surrounding it the difficulty getting their beer etc etc would i be underwhelmed would i be underwhelmed but feel somehow obliged to rate it high no way at all this is a seriously luscious beer now perhaps some people might not like the fact that a mere 8 beer lets you get an abv zing from it  some regard this as unclassy  but it works well within the rather glorious whole for me id happily drink this again hellya just maybe not at the cost it is imported into the uk 330ml bottle bb cant find on cap bought from a shop in belgium as part of a large pickyour own consignment to london,0.5390188261842718,0.9822
602,Bourbon County Brand Stout,this is one the finest generally available nonadjunct stouts around i had it on draft at whole foods rich thick dark and chocolatey the alcohol is there but not overpowering,0.5390184618666858,0.3182
1423,A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,burnt mahogany brown with a short mocha head that fizzles out audibly to a silky coffee black surface  first whiff is salted caramel and first taste is heath barboth associations coming across as instantly recognizable  sweet but delectable its got a sherry like oak that brings with it that signature nougat character charred barrel emerges more and more as it warms also with more heat yet never too much  the medium body is fine yet lightly syrupy sticky but its firmly dense carbonation comes into a nicely woody dry gullet warming finish while it seems like it might be a bit sweeter than i remember batch 2 in 2014 being theres not one single offnote    im not sure why or when these entries were merged since the vintages went through different treatments but the above review was for the upside down black waxed pint can in july 2021 i finally got my hands on a 2017 red waxed 12 ounce bottle and found it to be fully deserving of all its laurels  the oak is actually still really assertive the overall expression is peppery whiskey mature port and cocoadusted date all enveloped by an excellent char thats far more forward and bold than id expected without being overbearing or unpleasant its a dichotomy that doesnt often occur or even make sense as the body here wasnt particularly thick or dampening and such a bold barrel presence can often become too spicy boozy burnt or woody however here on exhibit is a magical convergence of fortunes  i can see how this rocketed anchorage to its lofty hype status but im not sure theyve ever quite achieved such heights again such are the perils of transcendence as such im not going to increase my score opting instead to keep the more recent but still excellent vintage as precedent,0.5390171482591282,0.9885
2790,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,trillium is an impressive brewer and this beer is well developed but in my opinion not their best pipeworks has devised beers with honey far superior than cutting tilesartaic such as sure bet and even spotted puffer orange haze decent head underwhelming in flavor based on hype lightlacking in a zing that i was expecting another great beer from trillium but my conflated expectations spoiled my experience,0.5390090239215453,0.8945
4882,Aurelian Lure,one of the jester king beers that i have been unable to track down until now highly acclaimed and on my list forever stoked to finally have sourced it its definitely one of the best apricot wild beers in the game so intense and so natural at the same time in a lot of ways reminds me of when i tried cascade apricot for the first time and just realized that there was no more true expression of apricots in beer than that this is the same but much less sour and with the classic jester king funky yeast mix that makes their beers so distinctive all the time a pulpy orange hazy look to this one under a short but lasting white head the nose is incredible the best feature of this for me and where i really appreciate the apricots most fuzzy and real fleshy and juicy and sweet and ripe their absolute essence some higher level bacterial acidity evident here too but all in service of the fruit nice oak to the flavor gives it a richness and a light wine and vanilla thing in the flavor beautiful with the pale wheat malt and the sugars in the fruit its funky and sour and also kind of desserty a little more left at the end of this one than in a lot of their beers especially these small bottle fruited releases and i love how long it lingers more sour than others too especially at temperature but it all works so well together epic expression of apricots in a really amazingly funky and mature wild beer up there with the best of jester king and certainly worth all the hype,0.5389731522180704,0.9953
1999,Resolute - Coconut,so im having this beer almost a year oldjust about two months shy coconut heaven  appearance is a dark burnt charcoal or wood type of color that symbolizes a a dark chocolate almond bar light tan head with fluffy bubbles which i wasnt too fond of  the room kitchen filled with the smell of coconut chocolate fudge as we began to pour this out this is a pure almond joy with a lovely bourbon character resembling vanilla burnt nuts dark chocolate and a balanced almost perfect malt roast  tastes like almond butter lightly burnt chocolate thats been living in a coconut cave with a lit fire for years very hidden heat given the high abv this is not the most viscous of stouts like the sugar mouth chewey monster bcbs but it is a beer that incorporates the barrel and coconut on a whole another level i dont feel so bad now for giving up what i did to get this  all in all this is not a coconut flavor you get when you rub on sun screen in the bahamas thats reminiscent of of chugging malibu before a highschool danceive been getting this a little too often with whats been out there this is pure joy seek this one out as its never being made again fantastic word class beer reminiscent of the og props and ba 4th et al,0.5389055425590253,0.8925
4469,Leaner,b2 this was a very nice beer although it did not meet hype beer was flat when poured the nose was all fruit the taste was jammy goodness overall its very nice kinda sucked that it was flat and side by side i much preferred fou,0.538784347596019,0.7364
2101,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,10oz tap sampled from a snifter at ansaris  eagan mn so i love vanilla and for me this beer is absolutely delicious strong vanilla in the aroma and flavor thick and creamy if someone told me i had to pick just one beer to drink for the rest of my life this would be in the running,0.5387825072814014,0.9193
4,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,2020 bottle  absolutely bonkers maple syrup on the nose coffee opens up after a minute but this beer straight up nails the syrupsoaked french toast profile hate the smallformat bottles wanted more,0.5387728085669589,-0.5719
3725,Double Stack,canned 09062019 poured 01162020  a pitch black absolutely no light is getting through this one pour creates about a quarter to half a finger of light tan head that dissipates relatively quick  s oh man the second you open this can the immediate area around you is consumed with maple and coffee this may be the best smelling stout i have ever had there is a slight bitterness once you really stick your face in for a smell but for the most part you can tell this is a maple bomb  t you are initially hit with a strong roasted coffee flavor that has a nice chocolate malt backbone to it this evolves into a subtle maple sweetness that compliments the underlying bitterness well i personally could have done for a tiny bit more maple that aligns closer to what i get on the nose but you do get a wonderful maple aftertaste though  f the beer nicely coats your mouth with a thickness that is pleasant without being too sticky this is about what i would expect from a stout of this size i could do with a tad creamier mouthfeel but perhaps i am just drinking too many barrel aged stouts  o i really love this beer it gives the impression of being just a sugary maple overload but the coffee and chocolate malt makes it a very well balanced and enjoyable beer while it is a pretty big beer at 11 it encapsulates it so well you wouldnt even know i luckily bought a ton of these bad boys and i couldnt be happier about my decision if you get a chance please try this beer,0.5386243715218959,0.9942
392,Assassin,surprise on tap at brewery july 26 look  jet black with brown edge on glass smell  holy cow huge smell and such a punch amazing taste  this stout blows me away such a chocolate punch feel  very very thick must sip little by little overall  a knock out mornin delight and i assume kbbs are only better because they have a sweeter taste to them hope to try kbbs soon coming in dec for another release,0.5385280266721199,0.9559
3967,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),2018 vintage  drank on 7132019 definitely bourbon to the taste plenty of anise very complex thanks to jhavs  2019 vintage  drank on 7132019 counterintuitively this is smoother and has more pronounced chocolate i prefer it to 2019 awesome thank you to jhavs again,0.5384849960672909,0.9096
69,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,this review is for batch 2  l similar to most stouts dark brown to black with a mocha head started around a finger on the initial pour faded to a thin ring that lingered mediumthin pour  s blend of dark and milk chocolate some molasses and chili every now and then i get a little bit of green apple from the brandy  t kind of weird not saying thats bad its mostly chocolate mix of milk and dark like the smell with some chili heat on the finish every now and then i get hints of dark sugars and a bit of green apple  f medium feel a little booze burn could be thicker and richer  o its good but i wouldnt put it near its ranking it makes me wonder how awesome batch 1 was not that im ever going to get to try it its definitely worth a try if youre into pepper stouts,0.5382477143896371,0.9576

5654,Tweak,bottled october 2017 my daughters bf brought me two as a peace offering so here go pours dark brown with a slight tan head that disappears quickly it smells a lot like a regular bourbon county heavy barrel bourbon presence the mouthfeel is a little thin after 35 yrs but thats to be expected a little evidence of oxidation but omg this is a big boozy brawny monster thats had its rough edges buffed out vanilla anise barrel bourbon a little coffee that peeks thru here and there it is superb and drinkable for such a huge beer i normally advocate aging a beer for no more than a year year and a half but there are exceptions and this is one of them my second stout by avery and another great one cheers,0.5380487964252245,0.968
2040,Keene Idea,alpines litmus test to me involved having keene idea originally toronados 25th anniversary beer on a beer list already with outstanding beers i prefer not to use tasters because i like to soak up a greater experience with a given beer so after a round a nelson keene idea had a high mark to hit on to the beer  this beer is light orange colored and topped with a short head with solid retention on top i took a smell of the beer and at that moment i was assured by the usda that i had consumed my daily requirement of fruit as this beer is big on fruit a smash to the head with passionfruit followed closely by succulent guava cantaloupe and mango  theres no way that a stablemate of nelson can be better tasting could it at times i thought that keene idea had climbed mount everest to be with nelson while overall it doesnt quite hit that stratospheric peak keene idea is undoubtedly outstanding beer the beer is not bitter yet full of hoppiness and more the tastes of orange passionfruit and guava are unashamedly fantastic and that alcohol level does not cross the palate immediately further making my pint dangerously drinkable its full bodied and very smooth and already being such a great beer felt that this beer was not playing fair  keene idea is a beer that im sure made dave keene smile from ear to ear this is a fantastic beer,0.5379651530755906,0.9841
4422,Hopslam Ale,2621 clear amber nice dense white head recedes slowly to a very lacy cap i without thinking took a sip before i even opened ba it knocked my sox off it tasted so good smells just slightly like an ipa faintly hoppy ooh the taste its unusual and very pleasant the mouthfeel is just right perfect it feels like beer after two sips this may be my new favorite beer well later sips were a little less spectacular well have to see if it becomes a favorite i expect there may be more of it but at 2149 a six probably not all that often  2921 the taste is full robust and it is somewhat bitter with a hint of sour the taste of this second one didnt measure up to the first but no adjustment to the score,0.537960774367734,0.8988
3086,Parabajava,a very dark looks a bit thinner than other stouts no real head to speak of  sall those usual fw barrelwork notes at work caramel booze wood and coffee  t chocolate molasses vanilla coffee and wood again but excellently blended as you would expect from fw  m again a tad thin for a stout but im nit picking  o excellent glad i finally got to try this one as its very hard to come by in ny,0.5377850836433535,0.9443
3752,Upper Case,i enjoyed this beer especially the nose the nose promised bright floral hop perfection but after taking it on i expected the taste to be different it is more earthy than i expected it is a great dipa but the taste does not invite the next sip as well as other excellent ipas ive had from this fine brewer,0.5377056798030021,0.9697

2748,Mexican Brunch,ive had this bottle on my wish list for a while  probably since the first time i tried abraxas id hoped it might be similar or even better  mexican brunch isnt exactly what id hoped but it does have a very pleasant balance  the chilis are mild while the nibs have more of a bakers chocolate quality  not too cloying not too sweet not too spicy its quite pleasant  i certainly prefer abraxas but this is a very nice beer as well i appreciate that the carbonation isnt super aggressive  its very easydrinking,0.5375036014003438,0.9727
4219,La Fosse,first sp fruited beer la fosse is fine pretty good even but it suffers from the overwhelming amount of acidity reminded me of upland i definitely dont think its worth what it trades for if you want apricots i think nearly every other similar beer is much better aurelian lure apricot bu apricot fruit stand fou foune west ashley etc,0.5375017576483077,0.7312
3421,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,picture yourself in a boat on a river with single hop additions and bright mosaic skies everyone smiles as you drift past tap lines as you drink you get incredibly high  welcome to a beer that elevates itself above the rest of its class such a beautiful beer  drinking from a keg in a 13oz snifter just a great moment defining that there are still flashes of self indulgence that enhance the expectations with small treasures in dark times  bright neon yellow orange color and a sweet tropical nose with a boozy hint full mouthfeel and taste follows the nose dont miss out  drink enjoy express,0.5374730943703888,0.9828
2606,Alter Ego,another one of the beers picked up from treehouse during the late october trip to new england this review is written after having the beer three times once as an extra once fresh once 70 days after purchase  pours a moderately yellow haze with 34 white head has the basic proprietary dry hopping mosaic and amarillo two heavy hitters dropping plenty of nose candy in the form of citrus hay and passion fruit  taste is another winner 50ibu levels of bitterness saturated in aroma hops keep the notes of orange and grapefruit coming body is light pretty much just some pale toasted malt and 2 row might be a mild flaking of some alternative non barley grains slight green hop burn on it far from problematic can still drink multiples of it its good stuff but it seriously has so many equals out on the left coast that arent hyped to the same degree i guess when you split stuff like this between 4 breweries versus hundreds in a geographic region its bound to happen in the end a good beer done thousands of similar ways by different breweries in your local area,0.5374385195834416,0.8847
1252,Anabasis,blend 3  pours a deep rich brown in color  minimal head not very much carbonation favorable in my opinion its tremendously rich and sweet with a fair amount of hop presence with a fair amount of barrel  not as much as id expected  i think id prefer aaron on any given day but anabasis is still tremendously good,0.5373189006189214,0.928

2857,Samuel Adams Utopias,not sure this should be classified as beer just saying 2019 version poured from the really cool bottle into a 4oz tasting glass  looks like a tiny glass of amarettonose is boozy sweetness taste is complicated by the booziness maybe an exponentially intensified flavor profile yeah thats it 20 years of aging and blending there is nothing to compare this to,0.5372618822075749,0.8191

625,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),look it looks like its a light brown with touches of orange it looks like light should be able to penetrate through it but it absolutely does not  smell wet damp wheat heavy fruits raisin bread  taste figs figs and figs dates a very moist cinnamon fruit and raisin cake brown sugar wood  feel smooth a bit of heat suprising as everyone says you cant detect the alcohol at all  overall the big question is it the best beer ever not as far as i can tell it is fantastic but it does have a bit of alcohol tangbitternessheat a fantastic quad but id probably take st bernadus most days especially because its so much easier to get this bottle was 3999 no regrets happy to cross it off the list but i wont be seeking it outunless im in belgium,0.5371796202419364,0.9715

2929,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,2018 vintage on tap in a 10oz flute carbonation is subdued and the beer only has a very slight ring of dark brown head drank side by side with a jamaican speedway  these beers are quite easily distinguished in appearance and in taste which surprised me a bit ive had quite a few of the speedway variants now and they all have their own very unique traits  barrel aged speedway has quite a lot of bourbon to the nose and taste the coffee is rich and roasty but not strong and lacks any acidity the barrel is also quite present with a light woody dryness  to this day i still think that rye vietnamese speedway is one of the very best beers in the world  and bourbon barrel aged speedway isnt far behind it in quality id like to see what some age would do to this beer but not too much  i had a 2013 recently that was tremendously oxidized,0.5371037083772996,0.8893
4665,Adam From The Wood,12oz bottle  2018 vintage  big huge giant thanks to phil for this beautiful son of a bitch adam from the wood is the darkest of browns bordering on black its much darker than the original its also still like many of the newer hotd special releases a hard pour produces a couple fleeting bubbles here and there but this puppy is flat its worked in past iterations so lets see where it takes us here  the nose is off the charts i love regular adam its complex and dense the wood aging puts this one over the top old dry leather and tobacco kick it off a little soy adds umami handfuls of prunes and dates and figs the tobacco is sweet like grandpas pipe tobacco what the 3 year barrel aging does is wrap that whole beautiful complexity in a big giant bear hug of oaken vanilla its comforting and rich and elegant and decadent and perfect this stuff smells absolutely amazing  nothing can touch that nose with that said the flavor aint none too shabby that sweet pipe tobacco gets things started and is met with the prunes and dates they soy is fleeting but there the leather is old and well worn quality cocoa powder lingers on the swallow again all this is surrounded by a rich luxurious oily oaken vanilla there are so many layers of flavor and theyre all in such perfect harmony that its mindblowing  though this beer is flat i think that bubbles would actually ruin the experience and an experience it is this beer is full bodied and plush with a velvety feel as full bodied as it is the tannins from the extended aging dry up with finish and leave very little residual stickiness as robust and decadent as this beer is the alcohol is almost nonexistent its a sipper but one that gets sipped often  adam from the wood is just about as near perfect as you can get the barrel aging has added amazing qualities to an already amazing beer this beer is as comfortable as old slippers as a roaring fire in a winter cabin as a snifter of cognac on a bearskin rug old well fingered books a labrador with your nightly newspaper,0.5371003555512832,0.9984
635,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),got 1 bottle of this beer as a gift from my polish friend  thanks rob about 3 years old this bottle poured a 1finger head into glass the taste was special complex chocolate flavors malty and smooth  brown sugar and molasses a great sipping beer to drink on special occasions overall the best strongest beer i love the complex flavors and smell of the beer also probably the first and last time ill drink one of these im happy that i had a chance to have 1 bottle  cheers,0.5370534908724357,0.9851
936,Fuzzy,blend 3 375 ml bottle drank out of a hill farmstead tulip wine glass on january 21 2001  poured clear gold with a nice white head that settled out with a little white head remaining around the edges smelled tart and slightly acidy taste was the same but not as in your face as i had expected this was my first side project beer mouthfeel was about right with the medium pucker and quench really enjoyed this  reminded me someway of fou foune even though that one is apricots cheers,0.5370007643666603,0.9142
1358,Rare Scooop,not surprisingly this beer delivers on its purpose it is pretty sweet to me but its supposed to be rich and thick coats the mouth and hangs around  the most impressive part is how they send a wave of each flavor across your palate no joke finishes strong with strawberry not a lot of bourbon barrel to come through but its there and a nice compliment,0.5369519437560631,0.9761
4542,Impermanence,the concept of inundating a brew with ingredients may work in the world of ipa but it does not imo in the world of stout the balance is lost completely this pours like sickly treacle or motor oil and its so heavy bodied it drinks like sludge way too sweet yes imperial stouts almost always knock your socks off with strength but usually there are some understated flavors that carry themselves gracefully this lacks all nuance its too much american brewers are often guilty of being overly ambitious and pushing their brews too far away from tradition this is a perfect example of pushing a stout to the point of being undrinkable to where it no longer is beer and in that regard it is successful this is an ice cream topping,0.5368708419477841,0.9876
3278,Bomb!,this was my first beer from prairie and its been one of my favorite shelf beers since then around here it runs about 54964912oz bottle a bit pricey but for what you get in the bottle its worth my money  standard stout appearance dark body tan head not incredibly thick but good character  smell is almost all chocolate and coffee  taste follows smell with slight pepper burn on the back end the pepper is mellow compared to beers like mexican cake but its definitely there  feel is nice like i said earlier not thiccc but kinda slick leaves a coating on the tongue  overall this is a beer a walk past a lot lately but its always good a special place in my heart my favorite shelf beer by far,0.5367657550034604,0.9915
213,King JJJuliusss,king jjjulius ive had multiple batches but the review is for the one canned 60821  look pours golden orange there are almost multiple different golds and yellows depending on where in the glass you look could just be the lighting leaves amazing glass lacing this beer glows  smell theres a brand of oj cant remember which that makes a ojmangopeachpineapple juice blend this smells exactly like that orange and grapefruit peel mangos mango sorbet peaches pineapple juicy fruityou get the idea  taste this batch was unique in how juicy fruitcandied orange it was up front its actually crazy how much it tastes like juicy fruit you then get the tropical fruits that were on the nose very minor green bitterness on the backendjust enough to dry things out it was a just a tad watery on the finish oddly enough  feel very creamy as is the case with most th big beers  overall this is definitely one of the best ipas out there i got it on a road trip while hitting 9 different ne breweries hill farmstead fox farm oh etc and there werent any ipas better than it however there are so many great ipas out there that i wouldnt necessarily go out of my way to get it the difference between this and other great ipas are maybe 510 at best,0.5366697966622244,0.9866
881,Parabola,100 score on ba  world class id think that would be recommended first try on this on the eve of another bday in my 6th decade of life this is a 2020 consumed in a very hot record setting june day 2021 that is one dark beer no color highlights small dark beige head deep rich fruit on the nose really nice chocolate flavor that is bittersweet yummy the abv is not overpowering in flavor enhancement but it hits quickly the dark fruit lies in the background a bit like dark chocolate on berries being only a year old it still has some bright sharpness to the malt profile nonetheless it is very smooth and holds a rich and full mouthfeel,0.5366575812510832,0.926
697,Very GGGreennn,can thanks to joe p  one of my final 8 top 250 beers list as of 7152020  l pours beautifully with a creamy white head beer is orangeyyellow  scitrus citrus and more citrus a bit of bite on the back  t smooth and delicious great tropical fruit on the tongue that gently goes back to a bit of a piney back end  m light upfront but pushes through to a nice presence that lasts  o up there with og juice machine as their best ipa glad to have finally been able to try this one after searching for so long,0.5365474344876358,0.9779
1486,Oude Geuze Vintage,i love 3f and feel no other lambic producer comes close to their quality and complexity of gueuze  the ogvs i have had fall short of at but are decidedly more interesting than regular oude gueuze even older vintages of regular oude gueuze  i have had ogv 07 oxidized and flat due to artificial cork 08 huge funk and fruit 12 brisk acidity and wonderful mouthfeel  may become the best of the bunch with time  all are world class with significant funk and complexity wish they werent so hard to obtain,0.5365004793261783,0.9831
5018,Gueuze 100% Lambic,finishing out one of the best weeks of my recent life right in the middle of this virus stuff i needed to finish it right i bought this at a bottle shop in paris in 2014 that is no longer open it was in my beer refrigerator since then  love this beer fresh and funky despite its age  you can almost feel the evening belgian breeze  poured from the bottle into a tulip glass cloudy yellow herbal floral funk smell and taste slightly sour but fruity and refreshing strawberries lime leather oak  i hope to have more someday when this virus mess is over,0.5364430721937068,0.6858
773,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,i have no idea why but this tastes like a lightly toasted marshmallow so good and so not what i expected it to taste like a must have beer for any stout lover and worthy of its acclaim,0.5364423144574726,0.9723
1659,Black Tuesday,2018 bottle thanks to the generosity of 2beerdogs opened in honour of my opa jan  pour is actually thinnerlighter than id expected though once it gathers in the glass it does gain some more of that menace but ultimately its closer to a coladark syrupdark chestnut brown than it is a molasses black not much head at all nothing more than a drifting of bubbles around the edge no lacing to speak of  nose brings less alcohol heat than id feared sweet bourbon vanilla and oak some caramel honestly just not as strong as id expected overall more pleasant and mellow and sweet  flavour again belies the behemoth that lurks in these waters 192 on the label but i could be convinced of significantly less than that maybe not half but closer to that than actuality while i do get some heat especially as i work my way through the glass the prominent flavours are more the rest of the barrel much like the nose vanilla oak caramel maybe a hint of sweet sweet chocolate maybe riesenlike toffee this is decadent and rich without really being luxuriant  smoothe and while its thin unsurprising given the alcohol and that it is not conspicuously so again this is a masterclass in taking an overbearing characteristic and folding it in to subtly be simply a presence that may sound like damning with faint praise but i absolutely do not mean it as such dangerously easy to drink for the nearliqeuer level abv thank you derek for supplying me with this delicious inebriant,0.5364374480055295,0.994
3877,Montmorency Vs Balaton,got to have this last week at the hops  pie sourfest 2019 in denver colorado what an epic day of drinking that was you know what i liked there more than any other american beer this one  pours a light reddishpurple and pink color with 13 lighter pink head the aroma is heavy on the cherry quite nice go balaton  taste wow just wow feels like they used 3lbs of cherry per gallon or some absurd metric conveying a shit ton of cherries so much cherry but there isnt an equally thick viscous cold medicine like feel to it they draft up a relatively innocuous body for the beer a lot of beers talk about their pie like qualities but this one pushes cherry pie weight like no other any acidity is restrained as can be oak is mild spontaneous funk notes are as well easily my favorite jester king beer and there have been a few excellent ones along with this one good cherry skin and pit dryness complimenting it all the way down  dammit i kinda hate that i love this beer so much given that its not available to me,0.5364335915771543,0.9891
4020,The Abyss,2019 reserve  the look is beautiful dark and opaque black with a tinted head  smells great cherry hit first followed by a kind of dark roast coffee the chocolate tones are there but not as strong as the others some oak  the taste is very good not too boozy but you can tell its bourbon aged was worried about the liquorice making it weird but it didnt do that at all overall taste is cherry chocolate malt coffee surprisingly well balanced by the bourbon and chocolate this stout is just sweet enough to taste quite good without being too sweet i love it  the feel is sort of light for an imperial stout this is preference thing but given the taste the mouthfeel is a little odd still its above average so dont worry too much about that  overall this stout is world class not the best in the world but definitely up there and i think it deserves the 99 only downside for me was price i ended up getting 2 bottles for 60 which is steep but eh whatever i cellared this stout for a year before opening ive heard the taste is too intense if opened right away but a year of sitting had it end up perfect,0.5364170993899506,0.9837
2838,Double Shot,traded for this and a few other bottles from tree house this week as i never had anything dark and heavy from them before although the vanilla bean take on this was better this was a solid beer that felt like sensual coffee in a bottle if you like your beer to be roasted slick and complemented by appropriate flavors then youve found your match right here  of course this poured quite dark like coffee with plenty of bubbly tan head to top it off that took a while to settle as there was plenty of clingy sudsy lacing left behind from the moment i took the first sip of this freshroasted coffee vanilla bean and extract rich chocolate and tangy blood orange filled the subtle nose as white chocolate sweetness espresso bean and soft cream came in to take this beer to the next level like its other iteration this came across as an imperial breakfast stout if one were to actually exist roasted malt somehow emerged through all of these flavors and enhanced this beer as it gave it depth without making it feel dry or typecast in the process  amazingly the booze in this was present enough to be felt but understated enough to let the other flavors take hold from the getgo on out a tiny presence of plum and dark fruit took hold before i finished this off as the acidity from that and the blood orange presence was enough to elevate this from the chocolatecoffeevanilla threshold that holds so many beers of this type back like their more famous ipas this was a beer from tree house thats worth seeking out or trading for  cant recommend anything in this series highly enough,0.5364089737248974,0.9256
4353,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream,ddh double mosaic daydream has been on my wishlist for some time now  i was quite happy to try it when a fellow ba reached out to set up a trade the cans were quite fresh  less than two weeks old  and the beer is tasting fantastic poured in to a teku the color is a lovely golden orange with a thick white head carb is light and the mouth feel is very pleasant  just a bit creamy quite rich and the finish is decently clean its quite definitely on the sweeter side of the spectrum and once it warms up and trace of bitterness virtually disappears  its not a particularly balanced beer as far as hops go  its definitely a very sweet ipa  but its damn fine for what it is that milk sugar is certainly present in the creaminess and sweetness i wouldnt want to sit on these beers  i cant imagine they will age well,0.536359841622254,0.9672
5002,King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,nice take on a favorite cant go wrong with king sue hazy and hoppy  maybe a little more grapefruit than the original easy to drink,0.5363308647371083,0.911
1214,Framboise Du Fermier,b2 shared on 81918fermier day pours on the lighter shade of rubyit was the lightest shade compared with quetsche kriek and bluet nice raspberry funk on the nose an initial raspberry flavor hits the palate but for some strange reason quickly fades as my acidic woo reaction kicks in ive read so many reviews here with the same jamjammy comments and i was very disappointed when i finally got to try this coveted brew because those 2 words are far from the truth jam is sweet something you put on breador crackers if you really want to be mr fancy pants this beer is strongly acidic dare i say overly so,0.5361297263315787,0.8873

5704,Fort Point Pale Ale,very balanced and drinkable not notable for a unique flavor but a solid pale ale that i enjoy every time cant hold up to ipas and dipas unless youre looking for something lighther,0.5358351904464675,0.7351
5495,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,2017 bottle courtesy of flintb back in nbs bif 007  side by side with a 2013 bottle of the basic expedition  pour is immediately evident that theres some differences dark brown head gathers and sits in a cloudbank across the middle compared to a pale desaturated brown for the basic a gentle swirl brings all the fuzzy mocha brown head back to coat the top thick obsidian body absorbs all light coming its direction  nose is more mellow than id expected some light spice and faint cocoa and a fair amount of molasses and some roast doesnt smell like alcohol per se but as i withdraw i can feel the evaporating ether withering in my nostril  taste is smoothe chocolate and coffee and toffee and some wood and is just really rich and delicious  holy shit this may be the smoothest most velvety perfectly soft and viscous drink ive ever imbibed and while it doesnt taste lowabv by any means the 128 is dangerously easy to forget about this may be the best mouthfeel ive ever encountered in a beer  man thanks brian for sending this my direction i will now be forever on the lookout for this in addition to the basic expedition from these guys,0.5357946180781336,0.9787
219,King JJJuliusss,so finally trying this one was an achievement did it live up to the hype oh yes absolutely insanely great balanced with hops fruityness as well as a solid body extremely well balanced delicious,0.535780927616305,0.9445
746,Duck Duck Gooze,did a sidebyside tasting with ddg allagash coolship resurgam and jester king spon methode gueze as part of our annual xmas eve tasting ddg was universally agreed to be third in the group and resurgam remains hands down the best guezelike american beer and the only one that can go headtohead with the likes of cantillon drie and tilquin  ddg was good not great it was visually quite lovely the aroma however prominently featured an offputting portapotty characteristic that very much distracted from the more pleasant funk and citrus fruity esters  fortunately not much of offputting aroma carried over to the flavor however it was a touch sweeter than id expect for the style and it seemed that a bit of wine flavor from the barrels came through in the beernot a bad thing per se but not really appropriate for a gueze style beer  overall a good but not overwhelmingly great sour more of an american wild than gueze standin,0.5357433354573802,0.6778
3569,No Rules,bottle aged a year i like some sugar but hate the overly sweet that still seem to score pretty high this brew was the sweetest thing ive liked interesting bravo,0.5357155216876084,0.9052
6132,Darkstar November,darkstar november comes all the way from california this is the 2019 release so it was aged about a year it is a unique ba stout because it has rye in the mash but aged in bourbon barrels molasses is also added so the result is the spice of rye the depth of molasses and the sweetness of bourbon it all blends together in a thick syrupy body great job by bottle logic  ig firesidewithphil,0.5357132535344776,0.9062
5243,Sosus,does tgbc misfire on anything sosus is an excellent dipa nice citrushoppy nose with the perfect amount of malt to hold it all together drinkable to the point of being sessionable,0.5356284700655155,0.8807
1343,Rare Scooop,the listing says this is retired but cycle had it on tap at barrel aged day march 13 2020 it was available at both tap stations and it didnt last long i got one from each station and it seemed slightly different  look a dark black with a coating of beige head that clings to the edges of the glass  smell one station definitely had more strawberry aroma both had vanilla and bourbon mixed to perfection  taste a great mix of all strawberry vanilla bourbon and cocoa as it warmed the chocolate was more fudge like and barrel cut the sweetness the first station did have less of the strawberry vanilla mix but the second one was great  mouthfeel a creamy mix that lingers perfectly it coats your tongue and leaves you wanting more  overall probably the best brew i have had from cycle a complex mix that works to perfection worth every penny to get attend the event,0.5355363829904455,0.9945
548,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,batch 1 drank on 3242018 split 4 ways into a snifter  look  pitch black low carb but still a little thick but not massive lacing still a lot there smell  sweet chocolate galore my oh my this really is a chocolate bomb that smells like a chocolate cupcake plenty of vanilla and barrel coming through but definitely playing second fiddle to the chocolate the coconut is subtle but opens up more as it warms really incredible taste  follows the nose however i do get some caramel in the taste too a really nice addition with everything else going on feelpretty heavy thickness no booze finish is exceptional really coats the mouth and lingers in a terrific way overall  the hype is real this is not overrated and this will age impeccably i had a small sample a year ago and thinks its improved a ton i think this may not peak for another 2 year to be honest incredible beer and could keep getting better wow,0.5354441200330419,0.9885
2379,Miami Madness,great berliner see little wrong with this one except it there is not much beer it is a little tart but fruit takes over everything which for some people is a great thing i wish there was a little bit more beer then a mango smoothy still crazy nose and great flavor though,0.5351977659855133,0.9371
880,Parabola,this is the 2021 vintage  the presentation on this beer is top notch a boxed 12oz bottle that feels super classy to open and creates anticipation as you read all the info written throughout the label also provides some information such as how many cases were bottled the degree of color ibu etc this is a level of detail that i have not seen anywhere else and really adds to the experience the beer itself is a pure black color with a dark tan head that is not just frothy but almost solid and sticks around for a long time  chocolate roasted malt coffee leather anise some smoke a hint of dark fruit like plum some spice hint of vanilla and then the bourbon  not overpowering but just enough to assert its quality wood rounds this one out nothing overpowering everything in its right place  starts off with a bit of hoppiness actually then covered quickly with roasted malt and coffee cherry and some other stone fruit a hint of woodiness spice rum something sweet like coconut finishes with hints of leather and then a final boozy bourbon kick right at the end to remind you of the source of this treat  there is a lot going on here but it all somehow comes together id love to see some age on this but this was a fun drink for sure a really complex one and im sure i havent covered all that this beer has to offer i will try to pick it up again next time,0.5351640674872984,0.9898
3742,Upper Case,traded for this a while ago as the date on the bottom of the can read 103116 yes i know its old with happy halloween written below it sure this beer was quite filling but the flavors stickiness and lack of any massive sediment at the bottom of the liquid led me to believe that this was a quality brew even down to the last sip  this beer looked like nectar as i poured it out with the waxy hazy liquid being quite appealing and thicker than anything that ive had from trillium hardly any lacing was left behind as there were just a few spots below a faint thin ring near the top of my pint glass lots of mango papaya ripe fruit and tropical hops in the nose as this had quite a heavy aroma albeit not anything terribly strong more hops grape white wine faint wood and hints of a wild ale came through in the taste as this was much more complex than i was first led to believe this malted out for sure but the pilsner and flaked wheat malt held on along with some of the galaxy as this was not light in body and had little carbonation to keep things lively  this wasnt light in booze either but it didnt knock me out at all nice to see trillium not brew a beer that i couldnt see through or reminded me of their other offerings dry like white wine i needed a bit of water to get this down when i finished it offbut thats not a knock on this it was quite a delicious beer that id easily get a second time around,0.5351424372871066,0.9834
158,Mornin' Delight,black like cannon fodder and aroma of maple and caramel a very pleasant beer but far from the 50 price tag a fantastic beer that should be a flagship for the brewery and not a large event once a year release specially since other special releases tg does are predominantly barrel aged good beer overpriced,0.5351382763668757,0.9513
6180,The Streets,canned on 31021 and enjoyed in a tulip glass pours a murky orange color with minimal head but some white lacing that coated the sides of the glass really enjoyed the nose of this beer overripe mango pineapple juicy peach apricot nectarine really thick and syrupy mouthfeel not surprising for a tipa hardly can tell its 10 abv this beer has practically all the hops which i thought was kind of a cool concept given the nod to the trillium street series this is the first time ive tried this anniversary beer and i really enjoyed it definitely one that needs to be sipped and savored not one id necessarily put in a regular rotation if given the opportunity given how heavy it is so its probably fitting that its a yearly release and kind of a celebration beer for now ill enjoy the 3 cans remaining after this one until next year cheers,0.5350716850930757,0.98
1290,King Sue,the color of this beer is really attractive very hazy and golden yellow moderate citrus and floral aroma but i was hoping for a bit more than i got fairly easy to drink for an imperial ipa and the flavor really explodes in your mouth one of the better neipas that ive had but might be the slightest bit overrated it just didnt knock my socks off like i was expecting,0.5350650186113709,0.9497
5576,Ghost In The Machine,tracked down a few singles of this one while on the panhandle this one was 2 months old into a wine cab glass that could almost work as a tulip pours a beautiful turbid golden orange good 1 finger head good retention and lacing nose is serious citrus fruit and maybe a little tropical candied citrus peel and a little orange blossom or something else flowery taste doesnt quite live up to the high bar set by the nose but it is still great though a little sugary to be ideal for me mouthful is full a little soapy and pleasantly lively with a soft but substantial bitterness a little burn from the alcohol too  as neipaapproachable as this one is you also kind of know youre dealing with a beast wasnt surprised to look after enjoying one on consecutive nights and see the ibus and the abv,0.5350307721005974,0.9783
4021,The Abyss,12 oz bottle bottled 4112020  yeah its less then a month oldbut it being the year 2020 ive decide to sample some as well as cellar some there are no guarantees these day  pours a solid black body with a tan head moderate retention several rings of lacing  wow theres a lot going on here  fresh cherry scent hit me at the pour but the overall scent is quite complex theres a very roastedburnt coffee thing throughout as well as an oak scent like a good cabernet sauvignon the cherries are still there as well as sweet and semi chocolate notes  taste follows but the booze comes out a little more the cherries are still prominent but the roasted quality is a bit more toned down  full and velvety feel  valueprice point does not effect score at 1879 for a 4 pack its a little pricey but the complexity makes it hard to resist  pretty impressive so much going on here perfect for sipping on a cold night,0.5349857482899479,0.9894
3365,Moment Of Clarity,capped off a week on the cape with a pick up from tree house on the way back the selections at sandwich are limited so i ordered a 4pack  it pours marvelously and has a thickly dark tabacco black aroma brings coffee and chocolate tones the taste follows but for me the prune overwhelms  this is my first milk stout so unfortunately im comparing this to memories of barrel aged stouts,0.5348893195037675,-0.6979
914,Westly,this has a beautiful apricot color with deep stone fruit flavor and refreshing medium mouth feel its very balanced and well made just dont expect anything super complex i dont see the need to pay the price to acquire this but its certainly a very good beer,0.5348516374450564,0.85
5158,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,my favorite ipa big fruit notes of mango and passion fruit not bitter at all easily crushable very lucky to live 8 min away from brewery  i always get it when they release it is a great trading beer,0.5348376106851405,0.9511
4869,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,2017 vintage tremendous taste and nose light coconut spice plenty of cinnamon not a very pronounced barrel presence but its there its surprising how excellent this is but being a fan of the base beer it should probably be expected  well done cigar city i know a lot of people look past huna these days  its impossible to overlook ba huna,0.53482229925209,0.9231

4816,Matt,2013 version on tap at the 25th anniversary party  not the prettiest beer flavor and texture are indescribably amazing  review under construction    2019 version from a 12 oz bottle  once again and as expected from hotd lately this bottle pours completely still flat as can be beautiful nonetheless the deepest shade of brown slightly muddled and has a reddish tint to it that reminds me of dried blood obviously there is no head to speak of and likewise no lacing  and there it is that glorious hotd signature aroma much like adam with notes of tobacco leather and jammy fig but theres the unique and subtle addition of smoke thats perfectly incorporated  this is just an incredible explosion of flavors that are hard to disect fig raisins and apples give wonderful sweet fruity elements smoke char and wood balance them out and leather and sopping tobacco leaves tie the whole experience together you could almost cut and paste adams flavor descriptors and there in the smoke and apple and that should just about sum it up  no carbonation leads to a very smooth silky and rich feel sweet and savory and surprisingly the alcohol is almost completely hidden hard to believe being 115  matt is just one of a kind absolutely friggin glorious and im so glad to have been able to experience this beer time and again both on draft and from the bottle aged and fresh no matter how you have it matt is one hell of an experience cheers,0.5345066332038776,0.9933
6013,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,poured into a tulip from the 750 shared by a generous new mexico ba  appearance was a thick and viscous and black as one would expect from motor oil or any big bruery stout  the smell was solvent as all hell and clearly suggesting some barrel and booze beneath were the pleasant dark chocolate and dark fruit notes one would hope for with the style  flavor was a huge turn in the right direction bursting with raisin and fig and enveloped in a rum flavor this resembled some boozy caribbean dessert ive had or dreamed of in my mind i really loved the sticky raisin wine like flavor with the complements of rum a friend accused me of harboring a soft spot for rum as the husband of a dominican woman to which i can only say yes i have a soft spot for caribbean women what was the question  and as for how this drinks come on now its a bruery 19er or something its thick as maple syrup and rich as all hell hard to complain about the feel and booze wasnt overwhelming the beer  very damn good,0.5344838804023266,0.9564
2765,Mexican Brunch,this is a killer beer quite deserving of its highly regarded status and a pretty righteous use of maple syrup but i think i just like their sunday brunch better i lose quite a bit of the coffee roasted bitterness here to the spiciness of the chilis and the cinnamon i mean there is amazing balance between all the added ingredients here and you can surely appreciate each element on its own as well as appreciate its contribution to the whole dont get me wrong but i liked the simplicity of the coffee and the maple too the cocoa adds a nice bittering low end along with the roasted malt and i get a unique floral honey thing in here too odd in such a huge and flavorful and dark beer but there it is the cinnamon is warming with the alcohol and the maple makes this wintery and cozy its not overdone but its awfully flavorful and probably as close to the line with adjuncts as i like to get most of the time still really maple forward but not as driven by it as the sunday brunch is cool beer powerfully flavored neat balance though and smooth and rich to drink on these guys have blown me away in limited exposure i need to find a way to get more of their beers in me as good as any of the more well known beers made in this style,0.5344104946029925,0.9928
5400,Very HHHazyyy,this beer tastes perfect to me hints of my very favorites very green and juice machine its got a crisp taste to the tongue like vg then gets very rounded to the roof and back of mouth strong hop thats utterly smoothed out by the fruit its like theyre flipping levers on all the elements to dial it all into balance dont miss this one,0.5343085378546585,0.9386
292,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),date february 1 2021 occasion having just posted my fathers obituary while three feet of snow fall i feel the night deserves something aged a few years glassware lindemans stemmed tulip pours a viscous jet black body that rolls out a a number of upwardcascading rivulets of effervescence its head continues the show stabilized as a thick halffingers worth of light tan creamy foam approximating a lattes froth rich vanilla maple syrup mellow bourbon sweetness a hint of smoke some alcoholic heat then heavy coffee bean and roasted malts arrive and the profile is quite a celebration the first sip is frothy at the start turning to velvetsmooth satin past the tongue and a warm entrancing finish that fires well after the teeth pulsethe hops are in hereand the mouth holds its presence the alcohol draws in and around but like the best it isnt tasted but rather appreciated rich is the wordeach sip is a dessert in itself a settling centering mood boost that makes one appreciate a massive collision of syrup and coffee initially arrest with intensity before the sweet bourbon charcoal smokiness chocolate and lactic acids round the experience into a drink worth mulling over i especially like how they ignored the bacon temptationthis works so well featuring the original kbs with a worthwhile variation its a compliment this urges me to finish and pour a dram of the jack daniels barrel select i bought a while back thought that introduces bananaeh another story for another time speaking of stories i had a bomber waiting to be consumed on my fortysecond birthday while staying with my inlaws in between houses and my son unwittingly smashed it while opening the refrigeratorthe dog loved it but we all cried a bit fortunately cbs returned not long after and maybe its better i drink it in 12oz offerings well this was worth waiting for and though it could be straight shot if only for its abv its sweetness makes each sip require a caesura before its next one,0.5342459172521866,0.9962
1955,Triple Sunshine,picked up a 6 pack of these before we left the source basically drank everything they had on draft but this seeing as how i was gonna grab a pack on the way out drank the first one at trekkies wedding  pours a familiar beer color yellowlight orange with 13 white head that dissolves at a predictably average rate aroma seemed to go with galaxy and citra hops notes of pine and pineapple were abundant alongside a mild sweet citrus component  taste and mouth feel are where its at has a similar to pliny like texture of corn syrup for drying effect and hop avalanche on top of a relatively easy going malt bill keeps the grapefruit orange and pineapple feels flowing the entire time real easy to drink hides alcohol especially well the pine seems to be from the boil the ctz they call em columbus for some reason in the more liberal parts it seems odd pushes through the entire drinking experience  definitely gonna bring one of these out to thanksgiving and see how much it changes in a 6 week period excellent beer bordering on world class for me,0.5340307709727224,0.9772

5658,Tweak,12oz bottle of batch 3 courtesy of beerloserli that was bottled on november 14 2016 that id stashed and afterwards forgotten about kinda wish id remembered it earlier  poured into the glass this was was an opaque superdark brown virtually black about an inch of tan foam was present although it mostly vanished quickly not surprising when you consider the abv  boozy nose but not overly bourbony if thats a word what boozeiness there is actually reminds me more of rum theres a nutty aroma with a whiff of milk chocolate as well the coffee seems to have died out at this point  dark malts and booze and milk chocolatey sweetness up front pretty evenly balanced im kinda suprised how much alcohol there still is after 4 yrs  medium bodied with a fairly creamy mouthfeel  nice nightcap on this cold midnovember night while the coffee has faded its still a bit of a boozebomb after 4yrs curious how long youd have to lay this down for it to mellow regardless thanks brian for a shot at this at a time when it wasnt reliably available in my neck of the woods,0.5340134707558921,0.9548

841,Lou Pepe - Kriek,was surprised to be able to find a 2012 750ml that could be consumed on site at hill farmstead beer is a murky ruby red in glass with pick 2 finger head aroma is a blend of sweet fruits and earthy funkiness that blends really nicely together taste is amazing a perfectly blended mix of all the good things i like in a belgian lambicsour and done better than most any ive had to date its only slightly sour mixed with tartness and sweetness from the fruit but finishes so clean no syrupy sweetness on the back of the tongue like you get from some other fruit beers it was quite the highlight of my vermont trip to finally get to sample something from cantillon and if i cant have it at the source in belgium then sitting at hill farmstead on a 75 degree sunny fall day sure isnt too shabby a venue either,0.533997002373118,0.9771
603,Bourbon County Brand Stout,2020 vintage marked on label drink by 22jun25 printed on bottom of back label so ive got 4 years to finish it bottle picked up at liquor store for 1099 poured into duvel tulip  appearance  absolutely pitch black body not even a single ray of light passes through even with a phones flashlight held touching the glass on the backside fine lacing with a fine and even stick bottle says to enjoy in a snifter  close enough 5  smell  strong alcohol at first but still alluring because of the dark roasted character almost a little winey perhaps little too sharp at first but mellows and rounds out to perfection after a couple minutes in the glass 5  taste  amazing balance was expecting something as sharp as the nose suggests it would be but its actually much more smooth sure theres a lot of alcohol up front along with dark smoky malt and even some lighter sweeter fruit and vinousness that bourbon comes in smooth this is almost like a barelywine without the harshness 5  mouthfeel  medium bodied warm and gets even warmer in the back of the throat and chest as well 5  overall  delicious deserves its best in class score for its style not exactly as delicious as a kbs or cbs but has no faults to speak of and a lot of strengths going for it 5,0.5339926165734732,0.9917
4566,Abraxas,ive wanted this one for a while and finally get the chance to sip on it on a snowy mi sunday afternoon before the nfl conference championships get rolling  beautiful mocha head sits atop viscous jet black and smells of cinnamon chocolate and slight smoky pepper  i absolutely love mexican mochamole beers like this and holy cow does this one not disappoint cinnamon and chocolate lead the way and the cinnamon doesnt overwhelm in the least perfect tastes somewhat like a chocolatecovered graham cracker the pepper is slight and i dont pick up much heat but im weird in that i like a nice lingering burn in the throat  this absolutely was worth the wait just wish i had easier access to more,0.5339881014105403,0.9749
1253,Anabasis,i have long been trying to track this one down and i am stoked to finally have gotten the chance to enjoy it blend three an awfully fine example of the style adjunct free if i understand it right and truly wanting for nothing it certainly is a beast of a beer not just at this strength but also with this amount of oak and sweetness its a lot of everything and its a proper sipper to say the least deep deep caramel in color reddish in the right light neither murky nor clear someplace in between with just a short frothy khaki colored layer of foam on it from the bottle the nose is crazy an awful lot of bourbon and oak i think it was heaven hill barrels they uses for this and two years in them heavy vanilla wet tobacco and english toffee abound there some light tannins from the wood as well as some oxidation when i taste it something i never really mind in the style and really is a sign of its maturity the malt is huge sweet like brown sugar and maple and carrying that vanilla tune pretty nicely though the whole drink a ton of body on it and a long linger even with the abundant alcohol at the end its persistent oxidation meets a robust english yeast strain too bready and doughy even adding a lot of depth no hops really to speak of although overall this somehow has some balance between all the elements at the end whiskey for miles boozy and sweet dense and even chewy but also fully wintery warming and satisfying something to be shared for sure but a prime example of the style and what extended barrel ageing looks like impressive and worthy of being celebrated that said not the most interesting barleywine i have ever had not the most dialed in i dont think either but a special beer without a doubt,0.533951547081178,0.9968
3843,Medianoche - Coconut,dark pour no head copious amounts of coconut on the nose tasted shortly after ba aurox cocoacoconut which i thought had too much carbo and thought the medianoche was a bit flat maybe making ba beers isnt as easy as i thought overall its a nice ba coconut stout but i have other favorites,0.5338841600184058,0.5643
2329,Breakfast Stout,bottled 121 consumed 421 poured into a tulip glass cuz i like those intentionally foamed it a bit  beer responded w smallmidsized head taste coffee no chocolate no coffee  well chococoffee it is but medium to full not at all like a sweet mochajava just the echo of sweetness hops are perfect  you couldnt enjoy this with too little and you couldnt experience the chococoffee with too much perfect balance zero booziness for a heavy abv beer look cross between motor oil  espresso but not as thick as the stuff left in the coffee pot for 34 hours overall has to be one of my faves for cool weather beers can stand up to a cigar but also good alone must be awesome out of the tap maybe worth a trip to grand rapids,0.5338717316702711,0.9859
988,Chemtrailmix,had on tap at dld at a glance this looks like most other dl with a dark chocolate brown with a small head the smell is dark chocolate and cinnamon toast crunch when you take a sip the the cinnamon plays perfectly with the dark chocolate and cocoa aspects of the dark lord there is a slight heat and spice on the backend that lingers overall this is one of the best variants of dark lord ive had in awhile and get why people hope to get this bottle,0.5338575677656979,0.9413
3891,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,coffee usually creates a slightly astringent flavor for me in beers this one is no exception i would take base other two variants over this any day,0.533852855341538,-0.0258
554,Abner,poured from a can failed to capture the date but i believe from a fallearly winter release as always a delicious beer although this particular can was a bit murky relative to its peers still appearance didnt impact taste floral citrus fruits not juicy one of my favorite beers,0.5337125856571151,0.836
4664,Adam From The Wood,2018 batch from a 12 oz bottle  as advertised the pry of the cap nothing as expected with an hotd special release this is still burnt chestnut brown bordering black not a single bubble resides above yet adam from the wood is beautiful  despite a lack of pressure the ability to deliver aromas upon relief of the cap is impressive all the glorious elements that make up adam tobacco leather molasses brown sugar are met with a perfect nonoverpowering level of barrel influence lightly charred wood and decadent vanilla elevate adam to the next level  booze definitely plays a major role in the flavor figs wrapped in sopping tobacco leaves flash charred then lightly coated in milk chocolate oak and leather baseball glove ties that youve chewing on while playing right field for the last 6 innings linger in the end but then long after sips a refreshingly light implication of maraschino cherry only adds to the complexities like i said adam kicked up a notch the flavors sear into the taste buds  this is the weirdest and most wonderful aspect of this beer it feels watery almost too thin like a sip of actual whiskey in fact but only for a split second ive never felt anything like it it transcends into a silky sweet puckering mass with a blast of alcohol warmth it coats everything it touches and sticks like glue but then full circle the oak aging does a wonder of stripping the silkiness away  what can i say its phenomenal and a real treat added complexities to an already outstanding world class beer something ill never pass up on given future opportunities ill leave it at that  cheers,0.5336272996234318,0.9911

2999,Wide Awake It's Morning,bottled 041918 soooo much better than mbcp but im blaming the fact that the base beer wasnt fresh when i had it two days ago this is not only fresher but holds up much better in the bottle this is how i expected the original to taste and smell  this is almost literally like being at a fancy donut shop and taking their maple bacon donut some of their espressodark roast and putting both in a blender then adding some deliciously roasted malt a bit of earthy wood and some booze such a sweet treat  today is the big day hoping for good news soon,0.5333917972885072,0.9744

2170,Saint Lamvinus,january 1st 2016  im feasting on the 2010 addition of this bottle and it is a european treat with a barnyard smell that is appealing even if it is a little feral it has a rich fecund manure scent with horse blanket and soil at last after seeing these descriptors attached to wine and cheese and other delicacies i can see why animal poop can be something nice on a beers bouquet and the beer surprises again with the first taste and an incredibly well crafted sourness with any excessiveness acid trimmed and leaving a brilliant profile it hints and teases at sweetness but falls just short instead offering tartaric tang brilliance in a bottle with a side of horse,0.5330830348849408,0.9376

3491,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,i dont think it pours as dark as everyone says i certainly dont think that light disappears into it like a black hole and there even seems to be a slight purplereddish ting around the edges  the nose is bourbon and dark malts sort of like what i wish my wife smelled like after work some caramel notes  taste is bourbon and dark malts sort of like what i wish my wife tasted like after work a little oaky touch of cake  feel is smooth and silky not to thick not to thin sort of like what i wish my wife felt like after work,0.5328363146810496,0.9671
5926,Peche 'n Brett,moderate refreshingly tart but im not up there with this ales enthusiasts  peche n brett looks better than your average brett but not so good as the better saisons smells are intriguing lots of peaches followed by a heavy hint of brett tastes follow this is a wellintegrated ale it finishes tart dry and bubbly enough to cleanse the sweet from the palate by my pairing with a peach pie in season while the pie was the higher point of the meal peche n brett made it better and for that it passes my test as a very good saison  as a minor point my rendition bottled march 2020 is only 86 abv and that is fine with me too much alcohol interferes with food  ive now had logsdons four most often rated ales because of logsdons extra effort and dedication i can see why a segment of the craft market holds them in such high esteem but brett remains too much for my buds to like and there also is the issue of premium price so it probably is time for me to focus elsewhere and being a buddyduddy on the classic saisons tried as i have i guess im still just a euro saison head,0.5328343945482483,0.968
2448,Black Gold,good stout  a little bitter for my liking but still very decent i thought the taste was very decent but the after was not phenominal definitelty solid and good,0.5328097478915794,0.6788
1211,Framboise Du Fermier,while the side project wild beers have certainly been tending more acidic over the least year or so in some instances i think the higher acidity really works and this is a great example of that another one of the fruited fermier beers up there with my favorites in the series the plum the cherry and the blueberry and i think the clean sourness that ramps up towards the end is part of what makes it there is a lot of fruit in here and a serious jammy sweetness is contributed by the raspberries so the sour almost works to enhance and balance it and with all the oak this has on it along with the lemony funk the drying cereal grain base and the obvious maturity its a complex and balanced brew that delivers what it seems to promise i am not sure if this was aged in wine barrels or not but it sure seems like it was some notes of red and black currant in here a tart cherry thing and even a light strawberry thing they all make it seem vinous to me so does all the tannins in here i even get trace watermelon flesh juicy fruit gum and red wine vinegar suffice it to say there is quite a bit of depth to this the fruit is insanely natural really forward and expressed beautifully through this base saison almost as intense as i remember them being in the raspe although i know this has to be less per barrel right i also like it being a little stronger here seems to slow me down allow it to warm and open and cut some of the flavor intensity with a little palate clearing alcohol brilliant stuff good carbonation too especially compared to a few of the others in the series the beat goes on for side project,0.5327472880191546,0.9869
5574,Ghost In The Machine,ordered this at a bar after the previous ipa ran out while on vacation was pleasantly surprised at the amount of aroma and flavor from this beer with a bright citrus flavor and enough malty sweetness to balance out the back end was able to find a couple packs of it at a local package shop to take home to enjoy highly recommend this beer,0.532663954081322,0.9441
123,Heady Topper,this beer has always been one that i have admired from afar i remember when i first joined this site over a decade ago this beer was 1 out of the blue we got a shipment in co no idea if this is a oneoff shipment or not but i was elated to find this one hanging on at my local store bought at hazels in boulder co on 051321 4 pack of 16 oz cans for 1849 before tax canned 050821 consumed 051621  as not only is it marked on the cans but i remember seeing an interview about the alchemist where john kimmich was super adamant about not pouring this beer out into glassware however i properly rate this beer i am going to have to make a compromise poured a little out for look and smell drank the rest from the can translucent canary yellow beer lively looking with bubbles of carbonation rising up head a bright white and pours at a little less than a finger but retains really well in a thin layer and leaves globs of lacing aroma is probably my least favorite part of this beer but still great i get citrus mostly lemons cane sugar sweetness and some resiny hops  tm spectacular and unique even with all the hazys on the market nowadays this one still stands out even though the can clearly states that this beer is not intended to be the biggest or most bitter but it hits huge hop flavors most piney and resiny but with more subdued notes of floral and citrus grapefruit and some lemon slightly spicy towards the finish mostly black pepper and a little chili pepper bitter and dry finish not as juicy as other hazys but it works well with this beer to johns credit i do think this beer is better consumed out of the can i think it really does taste better fantastic mouthfeel it is very crisp but combined with a medium body this beers texture is nearly perfect  overall wow i am so glad i had an opportunity to try this one definitely lived up to the hype belongs in my top 10 and it is the best hazy ipa i have ever tried if you can find it even for the price it is amazing and well worth it,0.532578754458759,0.9983
276,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),my first taste of cbs was two years ago when i had one from that years bottling i wasnt blown away as the sweet maple flavor came across as too strong later i tried a bottle that was over a year old and then was blown away so i decided to now give this one a true review bottled 1092019 poured into a snifter great stout appearance with inky black color and tan lacing that settles into a consistent ring around the glass smell is of mocha coffee and maple with light bourbon a great blend of aromas lovely taste that balances all of the aroma components the bourbon is just right in that doesnt dominate the other tastes mouthfeel is typical of a first rate stout im glad i gave cbs another try as the extra aging in the bottle imo represents at least to my taste the beer with a world class rating,0.5324877904795916,0.9796
3545,Fundamental Forces,this was poured as part of a blind vanilla share 2019 vintage surprisingly ethanol on the nose and on the taste vanilla is present and still tastes pretty good but i do believe this to be overrated,0.5323603260340649,0.5267
2567,The Rusty Nail,2021 123  cinnamon and licorice are two beer ingredients that dont entice me so i passed on this offering last year since then i have tried a few ba offerings from fremont and they have all been stellar plus the cinnamon in the bbomb was amazing so i took the leap this year  there is just so much here and no one element dominates the licorice and cinnamon provide a nice counter punch to keep a sweet chocolatey stout in check the smoke and the bourbon barrels bring it all together perfectly the bourbon notes are so damn good no harsh wood or sharp alcohol the body is full and rich just an amazing beer  fremonts barrel program is among the best imo everything ive tried so far has had such rich decadent barrel notes they are clearly sourcing freshly emptied topnotch barrels and putting them to good use,0.5323368511530095,0.9882
1237,Vanilla Bean Assassin,what an incredible treat thanks to a very generous friend and ba was nervous opening such a rare bottle and the wax hardened into almost brittle plastic poured rather thick vanilla hits you like a truck on the nose tasted like lightly sweet vanilla ice cream with chocolate had it side by side with a 14 assassin and an sr71 but all 3 were very different even though the base is the same,0.5322840173799998,0.8615
37,Marshmallow Handjee,tastes like burnt vanilla coke aged in gasoline barrels  i love a boozy stout i love adjuncts and i like when theyre made with concern for tastebuds not just for how extreme of a flavor they can get out of it  hard pass,0.5322773900689857,0.9287
403,Fou' Foune,2019 bottle consumed 112620  my thanksgiving special beer for the day first time having this so theres a lot of anticipation its a gorgeous looking beer and as it warmed the smell opened up to lots of fruit and funk tasting it i get an amazing balance of fruit and funk it could even be a bit funkier for my pallet but its amazing its tart but not too tart my fiancé whos not a beer lover said it was too tart for her which usually means a beer nerd would love it overall it meets the hype and i need another bottle,0.5321504820460543,0.9117
3443,Hypermash Hydra,pure brownie batter maybe a little easy on the sugar all the the ingredients that i could identify were top notch fresh and blended extremely well especially the coconut not much lacing but thats not my biggest concern when downing a beer of this style best bl beer ive had since fo b1,0.5321208849081852,0.9413
1562,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),syrupy stout with a feel that completely coats your mouth and never surrenders its insanely sweet and the barrel aging does little to counteract this was extremely excited to try this and severely let down not sure why its rated so high to be honest almost tastes like a wineliqueur than a beer,0.5320531040050382,0.7877
890,Parabola,pours black smell is a lot of caramel but the balance of sweetness is phenomenal with the barrel first time having parabola and i will definitely be getting more of them,0.5320057233725012,0.8338
2141,A Deal With The Devil,got a chance to try this brew during beer tasting with a friend as always anchorage not only impresses with the content inside the bottle but also outside  as appearance is maybe the most lacking characteristic of this beer unsurprisingly for a high abv beer it doesnt contain much head head at all actually the color of the beer is a muddy brownblack thick looking even when poured the aroma is boozy upfront after time becomes super sweet other notes include caramel molasses vanilla and plums in no particular order  tm incredible build over time it is hard to predict what your going to get because this beer is constantly changing even long after sipping these are some of the flavors we were able to identify in no particular order of dominance marshmallow dark fruits currents macarons molasses vanilla and plums the mouthfeel is impressive because it is simultaneously thick and carbonated super tongue coating keeping the taste hanging around and evolving on your palate over time  overall first off truly mindblowing this beer clearly stood out as special even in a tasting that included abraxas which also happened to land in my top 10 of all time when rating beers i try my best to consider my personal bias toward certain styles and not give a high rating to particular beers because they are the styles i like barleywines are definitely one of my favorite styles and this beer is excellent for that style this beer is also unique in that i couldnt stop thinking even days after trying it only a handful of beers have had such an impression on me highly highly highly recommend this beer even for the high price tag,0.531991929864757,0.9963
529,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,the look right out of the bottle looks amazing has a great mouth feel that is like drinking brownie batter like many ac stouts it is sweet but the barrel helps keep the sweetness down some,0.5319592253086783,0.9446
5494,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,first 3 of the 4 pack were fresh and this last one is just short of a year in the cellar pours about as dark as it gets and just as you think there will be no head at all a centimeter of thick foam slowly appears out of the abyss nose is vanilla brown bread leather and what to me smells like brown sugar pop tarts taste isdamn thats fucking good pretty much what youd expect from the nose but the thickness of this beer is pretty amazing considering the abv and barrel aging some tobacco and some residual sweetness really round this out overall damn,0.5319460601139961,0.9467
5764,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,canned 112719 cause if i were here  you were there id meet you in between  this is a seriously sweet and chocolateheavy beer it tastes like tootsie rolls delicious roasted malt and obviously a ton of dark chocolate added which makes this a special beer thatd im glad to have tried but wont buy again,0.5319253657168878,0.765
3529,Mocha Wednesday,random preface  birthday beer its a 2016 ive had cellared for 10 months now but am eager to try it after recently having black tuesday the aforementioned being an almost transcendent experience slow sipping over several hours i didnt quite imagine my birthday being as boring as today was when i took a vacation day for tomorrow but alas ill make sure it wasnt in vain by facing this monster of a beer  l  teku pour remarkably lighter than expected very thin given the massive beer it is head dissipates quickly to all but the outer edges the lacing runs fast and falls like rubbing alcohol on the sides of the glass  s  black tuesday partially roasted coffee bourbon and oak loads of vanilla its incredibly dense and potent smelling im getting more raw oak out of this beer than maybe any other ive ever whaffed the coffee is surprisingly subdued theres something off though and im fighting the urge to believe this may be slightly soured  t  hot and sour well fuck my birthday and waiting a year to drink this  m  who care  o  depressed fuck turning 31  original ratings of look 4 smell 425 taste 1 feel 375 overall 1   round two  redemption  traded for another bottle to accurately experience and rate this beer this one is a 2017  l  again voodoo teku pour thin dark brown frothy light khaki head  s  light roast coffee alcohol vanilla very very oaky  t  there we go no infection here so much heat up front amazingly less sweet than expected with lots of coffee roast providing bittering the coffee however is not fresh tasting  its stale and past its prime caramel in the middle intense oak in the finish  m  thin fizzy  o  i really dont love this black tuesday was life changing but this it isnt its a shell of its base it lacks the dark fruit and complex depth of its iconic brother while bt was an instant top 10 for me im hard pressed to agree that this is even worthy of the top 250,0.5319040427571142,0.7884
4247,Saison Bernice,holy crap is this rated high i had no idea well its time then pours a cloudy yellow with 12 white head this review is from a sample on tap at the bistro barrel aged festival dry yeast brett nose to it light when you talk rustic agricultural stuff here it is plenty of leather meets wood meets hay meets various barnyard effects here this is what its all about layers of aromas  the taste is pretty nice you get about a 6 on the 110 sour scale soft acidity still plenty of those hay leather cotton humidity and barnyard notes its like a blend of a saison but the sourness of a wild ale light amount of pepper in the mouth feel along with all that other stuff carbonation is more than average  i really enjoyed the beer but wow i think if you put an inbev label on this it wouldnt even move the needle for beer nerds instead low yield small batches from a slightly out of the way brewery  ratings gold on ba i totally dug it but it didnt even stand out that day amongst all the other beers,0.531824784003462,0.9097
4476,Leaner,lucky enough to try on tap at falling rocks in denver if youve heard the hype believe it its what i imagine fermented peaches would taste like little alcohol lots of peach flavor a good sour funk that dances with the sweetness of peach never heard of this before my vacation in co id come back just for this,0.5316780546128804,0.8689
2178,Saint Lamvinus,between wine and beer this one is the least funky brew ive had from cantillon pungeant notes of merlot are present the lambic is present to balance the whole but never dominates the beverage quite unique perfectly mastered  more and more i drink this beer ive had multiple times from a bottle more i love it just sublime,0.5316627689517383,0.9367
4241,Saison Bernice,much thanks to john for sending me on my way with this in tow i cant find any date info on the bottle itself but i want to say he told me it was a 2016 i could well be making that up but thats the year that sticks in my mind for whatever reason its somewhere between batch 5 and 15 as best as i can sleuth up yeah narrows it down a lot  an aggressive pour gives me a golden yellow bauble that still has some opacity to it a nice finger of white fuzzy head is dissipating in front of my eyes but leaves at least some residual to appreciate  nose is sweet with belgian yeasts fairly peppery and some faint lemon and green apple has that character to it that tickles the back of my throat when sniffing around  flavour is a nice melange of lemon and pepper but less than the nose suggested and green apple and like undertones of marzipan with some of the belgian sweetness towards the end but not too much mildly grassyfloral and a surprisingly bitterdry finish,0.5316592211820498,0.9899
2642,Society & Solitude #5,canned 71420 consumed 73120  its very pretty for a beer the perfect instagram shot can be has for anyone with this given its bright colors theres a little lacing that stays around i dont get as much on the nose as id like from the absolute favorite ipas ive had it smells grapefruit zesty and you get that on the tongue the beer shines through in its bitter balance with sweetness alcohol is very well hidden why do they make these in only 12oz cans my favorite hop butcher ipas often have a softer mouthfeel than this guy but this is still wonderful wow a great ipa and so glad to be able to have some would never pass on it,0.5316172181192866,0.9876
2477,Sunday Brunch,what truly surprises me about sunday brunch is in spite of being a non barrelaged beer just how complex and layered it is the coffee is smooth and lightly roasty the maple isnt super forward but it adds body and subtle excellent flavor  tasting quite natural by the way the beer has great body and drinks easily i really like this one  i cant imagine drinking a whole bottle by myself but definitely enjoyed sharing this one with friends,0.5315869574458542,0.99
2125,West Ashley,this bottle came to me by way of a bif  i dont know exactly which batch it is but the fruit is still rich and deeply present the apricot notes are super ripe and pulpy its very sour almost cheekpuckering the fruit is still predominant though the sourness is very forward the pour is a lovely light goldyellow its just slightly transparent more than you might expect of a saison  killer beer  its tremendous thank you to my sender,0.5312879831001441,0.9348
4176,Art,perfect slighly hazy golden color was extremely active in the bottle before pouring the smell was pleasantly funky and tartyou can smell it the second it pours the taste blew me awayzero flaws as far as im concerned everything good about arthur with the added complexity and tartness from the wine barrels even has a bit of vanilla flavor in the aftertaste which was very nice less carbed than i was expecting and thats not a bad thingalmost creamy which i didnt expect either but i really really enjoy this may just be the best beer ive ever had wish i could drink this every day,0.5312502769665405,0.9767

614,Bourbon County Brand Stout,damn good beer and ill try to keep the review short  its sludgy going down for sure its a heavy stout and thats just something that comes with these kind of beers not my favorite consistency but everything else makes up for it  tastes delicious coffee vanilla bourbon chocolate all come together for an incredible flavor profile the 146 abv is hid really well heck this beer is so delicious i could drink 34 of these and then be absolutely floored after it all sets in  worth it 100 picked up 3 from total wine but regret not getting more,0.531093578823874,0.9164
1941,Triple Sunshine,this tipa met my expectations which were high i love how it is in a 12 oz can since the abv is so high true to lawsons form the malt is solid the beer is amber to dark clear bubbly and delicious the hops are not over the top and complement the high alcohol well i would highly recommend seeking out this one,0.5310813446601375,0.9551

3085,Parabajava,l  2016 tell poor extremely thin and extremely light for a big stout not what i expected head is just barely off white and very frothy and pillowy  very nice here  s  muted parabola and zero coffee i have nothing else to add  t  thankfully theres some coffee here very strong dark coffee too the sweet parabola base balances the bitter coffee elequontly  m  nice oily and creamy not huge but all around just nice  overall  this was one of my most looked forward to beers that i traded for in the last year and a half sadly while solid its nothing great and comes as a pretty big letdown for the stature its known for,0.530890002283576,0.7796
962,Ann,the 2014 vintage poured onsite at the hill farmstead taproom  l golden copal pour with medium head and lacing  s virtually everything on the top half of the bottle pour is wine and barrel the bottom half of the bottle opens up with floral notes some honey a little citrus and subtle funk  t wine barrels up front followed by tart citrus flavors and some earthyfloral notes finishing with honey and a touch of lingering bitterness  f soft juicy and dry on the end  o i had waited over two years to try this beer with unrealistically high expectations so i was slightly disappointed when i finally had a pour of ann and did not have the lifealtering 5outof5 this is the best beer in the world experience  i have had this beer three times now ann is a fantastic beer but not worthy of its hype to me it fails to break the hill farmstead top five,0.530794368247117,-0.2646
3729,Double Stack,16oz can dated 9619 i think the first digit is smudged happens when you dat eon the shoulder of the can instead of the bottom poured into 14oz teku poured the expected and typical solid black color with 14 inch of light brown head that had low retention and lacing  the aroma was all coffee full on burnt folgers no maple scent and no beer aromas either  pretty similar on the tongue with the maple showing up at the finish there was also a noticeable alcohol hotness that lingered on the back of the palate  the body was well thinner than i anticipated and thinner than the vast majority of big stouts the beer did manage only a semisweet finish i was expecting a grape lotion dyeabeeetus inducing amount of sweetness  drinkability will depend on your level of coffee tolerance i can handle it as a supporting flavor but when it completely dominates the beer well i coulda just gone to starbucks  overall not only is this beer not my jam i dont think its good at what its trying to be as always ymmv,0.5307431452186511,0.4643
2686,Black Tuesday - Reserve,from 750 ml bottle to snifter  a jetblack and viscous as hell pours like crude oil  no chance of a head under this kind of weight  s all the notes of a good barrelaged stout just rampedupa lot wafts of alcohol volatiles push the boozy aromas right to the center of olfactory organs allowing one to parse every scent charred oak vanilla cocoa ripe cherries notes of coffee and anise in bitter aspects of the bouquet caramel and freshly milled whole grain in the sweet obviously plenty of booze smells like a liqueur  m if this was any more viscous thered have to be a molecular phasechange to a solid bring a knife and fork just in case  t the first thing noticed at the front of the sip besides the booze is that its not that boozy not 21boozy i would have pegged this 1416 and the restrained alcohol renders the brew a lot more drinkable than it could have been also the high gravity doesnt overtake that buttery bourbony caramely aspect that makes barrelaged stouts so delicious a perfect balance of sweet and booze throughout the sip closing with a long finish really long    just a phenomenal beer one of the best brews ive had i was skeptical when i read this was their big hoarders special last year what was disclosed about the process led to a risky endproduct  a lot of ways this couldve gone off the rails but this is easily the best beer the bruery has brewed edit compared to bottles available to society members  im not able to frequent the tasting room that often so there may have been a oneoff gem i missed just wow,0.5307253422736055,0.9671
3520,Mocha Wednesday,it seems like im always a day behind when i drink these who cares anyway its like underwear with the days on them you honestly telling me you dont just feel like wearing saturday some mondays anyways im pouring from a 750 ml 2016 bottle into a snifter this beer pours out just like the others way lighter than beers similar in the style brown in color with highlights all the way through the smell is warming bourbon with a mocha backdrop raisins and plums evident as well the taste comes in with that same burning sensation and provides dark fruit notes a very nice chocolately finish there is some coffee and mocha presence in there but for the main part its slight and if not advertised i think most would just think of a bourbon barrel aged stout the mouthfeel is thick chewy and great for the style overall this has probably been my favorite of these so far but still nothing blowing me out of the water i guess ill just keep swimming,0.5307181927504514,0.9485

4772,Last Snow,quite possibly the best funky buddha i have had by far  right out of the glass it pours almost syrupy thick what ends up in the pint is black with a thick tancolored foam that foam was something to look at  never have i witnessed a creamylooking foam  this was creamy unlike anything else i have ever seen the scent was reminiscent to sweet cuban coffee with even the same soft touch of bitterness  truly exceptional mouthfeel was carbonated but creamy no dry finish to this drink the taste made me think it would be boozy maybe it should have been but at 64 abv its almost sessionable this is frankly a very good beer one that i didnt think much from the label art but as they say never judge a beer by its bottle or can or its label art,0.530668823250652,0.7287
1630,Focal Banger,drank straight from the can nice dankness with some good citrus notes i think i might prefer this to heady topper definitely one of the legendary neipas,0.5305806212731731,0.8519
3632,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,so im going to blend the scores here aged lpg and fresh lpg are two different animals this is comparison of a 2010 sticker vs a 2007 sticker had the 2010 on 122115 and then 2007 on 1116  2010 l looks like carbonated apple juice copperamber hue with plenty of carb 45 2007 l looks like carbonated apple cider incredibly murky 5  2010 s a bit more mild than i expected close to regular gueuze but a bit more unique some apple mild vinegar that cleaner cantillon funk but a little dirtyness 45 2007 s wow that is mouthwatering granny smith apples plenty of dirty funk but more lemony and lactic forward 5  2010 t same as the nose mild apple vinegar slightly soapy fresh cantillon funk with a bit of dirt 425 2007 t same as the nose very apple cider like tons of lactic mouth watering pucker lemon nice funk but a bit behind the lemon apple qualities 475  2010 f fine a bit thin like fresh cantillon gueuze usually is 425 2007 f awesome creamy and thick little bit lower carb but so mouthwatering more like a 49  2010 o great gueuze but not a big enough step up from the regular to justify the price 425 2007 o one of my favorite bottles of gueuze ever the extra few years of aging really made a huge difference or maybe it was just better back then who knows worth the hype here 5  so yeah if you go for a bottle of lpg plan on aging it for at least 5 years or grab a bottle thats already at least 5 years old this one was about 6 years when we opened it it makes a huge difference,0.5305687532095534,0.9958

1542,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),ive been chasing this beer for a while now  bottle counts always seem lower than other adjuncted variants and no one seems to want to let one go so finally caught it on tap this year  the beer obviously changes a bit in the barrel see all of the variants  what once was a cloyingly unpleasant overly sweet beer turns in to a much more balanced notinsultingly sweet beer that almost has a sort of buttery taste and aroma to it its thick and rich of course with lightly disguised bourbon this feels like a trick i almost wondered whether i had the right beer  its great  it still lets me down a bit after these years of chasing still great,0.5303151969662804,0.9196

1080,Double Citra®,well damn i thought the 6 pack of their mosaic ipa was the bees knees but holy moly this stuff   had it on tap at a bar in vermont not during our trip to the brewery  pours the most beautiful hazy ipa looks like orange juice this even surpasses the prettiest tree house stuff which also impressed me on how well it did with a relatively ugly style of beer 1 of white head on an orange juice like body keeping up with the orange theme the nose is all citra orange and tangerine where it gets wild is as great smelling as this is its the low point for this beer plenty of beers smell like awesome citrus  taste jeez man you know if this was a lot more available we could be flirting with a perfect 5 for taste truly separates itself as there isnt an acidic hop burn anywhere in the tastemouthfeel like you get with ipas that are very good its the best version of a hazy ipa ive ever had smooth yet dry has the best of both worlds much like the van halen song i dont need complexity just give me some awesome hop notes pushing orange and tangerine all day with a lower yet firm bitterness and an amazing crushability notwithstanding somehow this is 8 abv you can get wrecked on this effortlessly,0.5301038918432819,0.9975

922,Westly,wow thanks to drlovemd87 for sharing this rare gem its always a pleasure to get to share these with close friends this might represent the final evolution of the apricot wild ale and after being only lukewarm on the west ashley in regards to all the hype this one really takes it to the next level twice the apricots and twice the time in barrels the pour is hazy short of rusted orange pale and soft looking no visible particulate in here but still sort of raw looking nearly a full inch of airy white head lingers the aroma here is near perfection about is forward as apricots have ever been including allagash cascade crooked stave and yes cantillon too its juicy and bright sweet enough even fuzz on the outside just a little bit oddly nutty like the pits but that could be a handover from the wood the fruit is pulpy and ripe and dominant but there is a great mixed culture sourness backing it up cutting the sweet and highlighting some of the wheaty grain base and oak treatments all well integrated and powerful but also quite mellow and approachable as they go the flavor is still really ripe apricots and interesting funk and sour combined the fruit is incredible here maybe a step short of its explosive aroma but really pungent and to the point it tastes like a fresh apricot in the peak of the season as true to the fruit as any of the beers out there its quite sour too a lot of lactic acidity ahead of the wild funk aspects and well ahead of the oak it gets even more sour as it warms which it does in this instance because i cant put my glass down to stop smelling it a bottle of this might be a lot as a solo mission so i was really glad to be sharing it i could see the acidity getting overwhelming its like too much of a good thing a third of a bottle was exactly perfect probably the best expression of apricots i have seen in a beer and the white wine notes from the wood and the yeasts are a great compliment to the fruit easily the best of the beers i have had from these guys and probably the new benchmark in the style unlike the west ashley this is entirely worth all of the high praise it gets a memorable experience,0.5299113116901735,0.9989
1473,Oude Geuze Vintage,2010 vintage from 3 fonteinen cellar on 3302018 one of if not the best gueuze ive ever had incredibly smooth perfect blend of funk sour biscuit the oak shines through on the back end one of the best beers out there gueuze or otherwise,0.529896388684808,0.7013
4472,Leaner,killer beer amazing to have in such close proximity with the westly which although was apricot and not peaches makes a great side by side the beers are similar in some ways but this was much more interesting on the yeast front much less sour equally fruity peaches rule this one drippy and ripe just like the namesake aroma and flavor are the peak of ripeness hardly sweet at all just juicy and true fuzzy and woody and awesome soft yellowish orange beer hazy and heady well carbonated dry and who knew it was so strong on the booze you dont taste it in the least nor feel it at all brett out in front of souring cultures in this one for me funky and layered and real mature this must have spent quite a bit of time ageing fermenting all this fruit out the peaches are insane yellow and bursting out of this in some ways the sourness takes over the apricot in westly a bit here the fruit leads the way and is merely accentuated by the yeasts still plenty of acid but a lot of nuance to it maybe less wood but more interesting i think i like this as much as i liked either westly or fuzzy from side project in isolation and think if they made more of it it would have to be one of the most hyped beers ever its immediately in that range with stuff like fou foune cascade allagash and the other greatest peach or apricot lambics out there lots of wheaty body even oaty fluffy and expansive inviting micro bubbles are very active in it too i couldnt imagine this improving in any way its a truly beautiful beer thanks to claystation for sharing it with us a real treat and a new high water mark for casey and thats really saying something if you have been keeping up with their releases lately  edit leaving my original scores in place but we drank a batch 1 from ages ago this weekend and it really had changed acidity ramped way up peach faded way back and just a totally different brew still compelling and complex and delicious by any standard but a far cry from what it was when it was new and the fruit character was so explosive in here and the funk was on par with the sour maybe not meant for extended cellaring,0.529880799716541,0.9981
5661,Tweak,bottled 102717 consumed 81920  3 years is probably too old for a coffee stout imo but i let this sit due to the high abv its a thin stout and not quite as dark as id expect theres zero head after the pour too the smell is very nice though it lacks a ton of coffee at this point i get sweet bourbon booze on the nose more than anything on the pallet the booze is more reserved or enough for me at least and still very sweet im not getting a lot of coffee anymore but im sure compared to the base stout its present its sweet for sure more sweet than other coffee stouts but not a pastry stout overall a great beer but not the world class beer its rating says it should be versus newer coffee stouts i think its also a bit unfair given the age for me need to try a fresh one to be fair,0.5298439118030883,0.9899
4886,Aurelian Lure,i had this at the release on tap along side fen tao and later in the bottle i have to say on tap was better which is like saying the sky is blue in my opinion apricot is one of the best fruits to go with sour beers and this is definitely one of the better sours jk makes deep apricot flavor medium sourness all deliciousness,0.5298358485547736,0.9578
1957,Triple Sunshine,copper colored with a fingernail of off white around the rim and covering half of the top theres a hazy complexion theres light soapy lacing the aroma is of citrus with a bit of pine im tasting a wallop of citrus with abut of pine the mouth is sticky and resinous,0.5297782851800039,0.2023
527,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,had this stout at angry chair on 32021 so im guessing its a 2021 bottle a very nice guy sitting at the table next to me offered a pour from a bottle he was sharing with a friend to my wife needless to say i drank her pour jet black color with a little bit of foam smells like chocolate with some light bourbon notes taste is the best chocolate ive ever tasted in a stout rich sweet chocolate balanced perfectly with a slight bourbon taste mouthfeel was also perfect just coating the tongue this beer blew me away ive had the non ba version years ago and it was very good but this is in a league of its own the best pastry stout ive ever had the first perfect score ive ever given on beer advocate,0.5297365697091156,0.9837
3022,Grey Monday,good lord is this a boozy beast  i decided probably in error to drink a bottle by myself on a tuesday evening i had two grey mondays gathering dust in my cellar  and no one ever wants to open these at shares so i thought i might start thinning the herd full disclosure i only finished one glass before falling asleep  appearance brings to mind a barleywine more than a stout  grey monday pours a deep reddish brown and smells tremendously boozy seriously this stuff makes my head swim hazelnuts are faint in the nose but theres definitely a bit of warm nuttiness there its quite sweet and fairly sticky thick and oily  while bruery stouts arent my every day goto its difficult to deny them accolades  these beers are nuts delicious but they just arent practical when drinking alone,0.5297326185761432,0.679
1478,Oude Geuze Vintage,sidebyside at lambik o droom all of them had that signature green apple and barnyard funk but im gonna focus more on what distinguishes them from each otherfrom typical bottles of oude geuze 2003 ogv orangegold color full and thicker body plenty of carb old and musty huge brett pineapple shellfish notes super unique and absolutely delicious 49 2004 ogv magnum bright and wellbalanced apparently the bottles had a lot of off flavors originally and they were thinking they would have to dump these bottles they held onto them and im so glad they did totally turned the corner 48 2008 ogv tons of funk yet relatively mellow compared to the rest smooth and absurdly balanced 49 2010 ogv super balanced but the least interesting of the five 475 2012 ogv paint and drywall smells and tastes like a new townhome incredibly cheesy inyourface flavor 48,0.5297307074235656,0.9822
2840,Double Shot,absolutely fantastic everything i hoped it would be looks like a perfect double shot of espresso with a dark caramel colored head wonderful coffee aroma which comes though perfectly without any boozieness that a lot of stouts tend to carry,0.5297163736100947,0.9665
966,Ann,had it onsite at the brewery yesterday tons of honey in the smell but not much on the tongue lots of white wine type flavors great beer but probably not one of my top favorites,0.5296930178013556,0.9109
71,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,thanks much to chicagopubcrawler for making this one happen  was worried about the b2 releases this one in my opinion doesnt follow the poorer reviews  a beautiful stout not a big pop off the cap but the pour has a nice thick lacing smell is perfect chocolate no spice just perfect refined chocolate  taste is a blend of crazy flavors apple chocolate hard mexican spice love the integration of rum and apple brandy the spiceheat comes in at the back end as is intense mouth is dense and i wish more stouts could be just like this a little harsh with the peppers gladly shared this with friends and definitely two people would be too much for the intensity of the heat  overall this is an experience i generally dont go for this style and have had both good and bad bottles of regular huna im sure this was a good bottle,0.5296093918857214,0.992
2731,Blåbær Lambik,lots of people told me to not believe the hype on this beer i just think its impossible to get the strong blueberry taste like you do with a peach or raspberry lambic this beer was one of the best blueberry lambicsours ive ever had i had it along side a lot of different blueberry beers and this one was one of the top 3 the funk was soft and the sour notes were very light but it was very smooth and id definitely trade high for this again,0.5296031179520191,0.8573
3101,Consecration,disappointing in that it tastes more like a wine than a beer but thats the point its white grape residue that would serve better in a wine glass than a beer mug,0.5296016066292891,0.5642
2351,Trappistes Rochefort 10,found this dusty on a shelf in my local deli who knows how long it was there probably a really long time from the way it looked and the way the handwritten price was scrawled on a little round sticky on the top of this single 549 it said must be a good price for a beer that has a 100100 rating here im very excited to try it as its my first trappist ale poured out into a clean snifter light golden as it poured and darkening as it collected in the bottom of the glass nice inch of flaxen head that sticks around in a fluffy layer floating on top scent reminds me of banana and raisins predominantly and maybe some orange and grapefruit too as i swirl the glass the head foams up again robustly upon the first sip im not as terribly impressed as i expected to be strong malt backbone candies of butterscotch and sugary burnt bananas predominate also raisins dates figs but its also somewhat bitter with an earthy musty type taste to it somewhat leathery the 11 is well hidden and doesnt come through too strongly comes with a dry finish mouthfeel is full well rounded and highly carbonated overall its a pretty good brew but wont receive my highest marks its perhaps that im not trying several beers of this style in a row to pick the best perhaps my palate is still young and inexperienced but regardless of what others say i have to decide for myself i tend to like big heavy thick dense beers with robust abvs and maybe i was expecting the taste of a stout or porter my only reference for this beer is really golden monkey which i could just as easily pour if i wanted a beer of this style glad i tried it as it was quite the experience given the anticipation i had for this beer however im off to sample something a little heavier,0.5295390898233303,0.9918
5536,Birth Of Tragedy,sep 2016 batch says to drink within 6 months oops at least i kept it cold 500 ml bottle poured into snifter and let warm  l pours completely dark with 1f tan head with good retention leaves no lacing but persistent cap and ring  s bourbon barrel honey coffee and roasted malts always odd to have honey and coffee together but it seems to work here  t man this is good these flavors shouldnt work together but they do coffee and bourbon barrel up front and then honey comes in and persists through the finish it comes thisclose to running away with it and being too sweet but stays on the good side you also get some dark fruits and orange peel up front and in middle lots going on here really  f fullbodied obviously this drinks like the abv is significantly higher than listed here there is nothing on the bottle not much in the way of carbonation construction just deadreckoning perfect balance fantastic  o well wait are you waiting for jump in your cars and hope they have some at the brewery i think this is a fall release,0.5295357614173497,0.9864
576,Double Sunshine,i finally got this up in vermont this summer i was expecting too much from it based on other peoples ratings i actually prefer sos to the double dont get me wrong this is a great dipa but i am getting bitter taste from the hops rather than the sweet taste i get from sos i love how this beer is clear amber from the delicious malt wellcarbonated and easy to drink,0.5295026259856901,0.9742
4835,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,back when oh used to brew smaller batches this was easily the best beer in the world today less so but still packs a powerful punch  absurdly drinkable for an 85 dipa candy crush pineapple dreams  rip oh before they scaled up,0.529482115687979,0.8641
267,Very Hazy,canned 4 days ago and tried blind alongside a 10dayold can of haze both my friend and i were shocked to discover that we both slightly preferred regular haze and actually both guessed that it was the very hazy  the aromas were almost identical and the flavors were juicier on the haze and more bitter on the very hazy same fluffy mouthfeel in both both are stellar beers but regular haze wins both in terms of drinkability and availability  89100,0.5294381127608004,0.5579
6188,The Streets,really glad i was able to take an extended lunch break to try this much talked about beer  appearancewise it takes on the typical trillium look  opaque with solid head retention wow what an aroma  smacked me in the face  grapefruit resiny pine heaven however the taste is a little overkill i can tell it was brewed with 6 different hops  flavors are all over the place but ultimately it feels like im chewing on grapefruit skin  this is very good but a little overhyped people go nuts for this beer every year i would try again but not go out of my way for it,0.5291655484828246,0.8906
5702,Fort Point Pale Ale,99 yall are crazy maybe ive become so used to ipas and stouts which give remarkable favours but this was kind of bland and skunky tasting despite the week old date i got orange rind and dish soap it has a creaminess that reminds me of julius but its almost as is someone sucked all the deeper flavours out and left you with the base of a good ipa id never buy this beer but it was included with a package buy in concept a juicy pale ale sounds interesting but i think adding the haziness does nothing for the style this beer does not live up to the rating,0.5290879274493399,0.7096
539,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,thanks to heisenbrew for this 750ml bottle which i am taking solo tonight if you dont hear from me by sunday night please send someone out to check my dead bodys blood sugar level  ever go blind thats how dark the beer is with nearly no visible carbonation the nose is barrel aged brownie whipped up with bitter cocoa id eat that  imperial german chocolate cupcake  barrel aged was easily my favorite beer from tampa beer week 2018  the bottle doesnt quite live up to my glowing memories it is of course sweet enough that my vulnerability to type 2 diabetes just ticked upwards 5 straight corn syrup mixes with cane sugar  supremely bitter chocolate to form the base the chocolate actually took a half hour to warm before the nasty edge wore off the bitter cocoa below the sweet upper crust is a healthy helping of bourbon milky chocolate long pull of vanilla  cake batter i dont believe i typed that thick full comainducing pretty sure im not going to have any trouble finishing this off by myself that said im getting full  not as midblowing as fresh off the tap but still an excellent beerif you have a high tolerance for all things sugar,0.5289754787500949,0.899
1371,Aaron,huge thanks to bigda83 for this 500ml bottle that ive been lusting after for many gnat lifetimes bottled july 11th 2018  the bottle says shareim not doing that the pour is a dark red mixed with dark brown with the overall impression being dark the nose is unexpectedly light bits of caramel toffee brown sugar  half a rack of bourbon which is the only thing that comes on strong  maybe if i tell people my new kid is named aaron theyll send me more of this because its pretty good first off its like being beaten about the tongue  gums with a wooden stave thats brushed past a nice bourbon big big wood with minor bourbon the other main players are rich brown sugar toffee along with smoketinged maple  just a touch of booze exceedingly smooth  sweet 500ml is the correct serving size for this baseball player  so glad i finally had the opportunity to try this it didnt lead up to the legendary hype but its an excellent beer that deserves to be in the top echelon of barleywines,0.5289219927530158,0.9715
4773,Last Snow,whoa this is expensive for non imperial stout i forked out 5 for a single 12 oz bottle im a fan of funky buddha  what they do for the florida craft beer scene there is interesting looking chocolate snowman artwork on the label wow i am getting big coconut aroma from this beer i am not seeing any date on the bottle a beer that has coffee  coconut adjuncts needs to have a date on the bottle somewhere i am ascertaining big coconut slight coffee i cant lie to you this is scrumptious if you like a sweet stout that does not have lactose added to it then this is up your alley although it is costly but i dont downgrade beer because of their price pretty good porter that almost feels like a full bodied roasty stout this is a sweet stout all the way with slight roasted malts this is a beer that i would not session due to the sweetness of the coconut  the edginess of the coffee but its a great one time one bottle treat for the evening but its definitely not something that i would want to session cheers a,0.5288045531767285,0.9942
3069,Parabajava,12oz bottle of 2019  coffee so well done as complimentary accent nose was far more dynamic on the bottle and the taste was exquisite more coffee presence than the previous batch loved it,0.5287992673543966,0.9088

285,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),since its a cold and rainy night with spring fast approaching i figured tonight was as good a time as any to break out the founders cbs from 2018 it pours a usual dark brown color and has a chocolaty brown head the sweetness is apparent on the nose but belies the intense maple chocolate and coffee flavors that masks the 10 alcohol im glad to have tried this its definitely one to share during the colder season,0.5287630271150102,0.9287
2214,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,after trying ddh congress ddh summer ddh sleeper dialed in and this one galaxy dry hopped fort point was perhaps my second favorite it was incredibly smooth and juicy with the least amount of bitterness of the group and the best most consistent and even aftertaste sleeper and dialed in were better looking brighter and hazier but this is just such a crushable ipa,0.5286468726718528,0.6705
4662,Adam From The Wood,a classic this one is 2018 it looks just as it should calm and a little dangerous the nose waves a baseball bat worth of flavors around behind its back and says im going the hit you with this very soon raisincherry fruit tones come to the fore backed by brandy and vanilla cookies and of course the taste does indeed clobber you with huge crescendo of coffee fruit booze char leather and umami fantastic the mouthfeel again is just as it should be this is a unique beer and very much deserves its high reputation speaking from experience and without any fear of contradiction i can also report that this beer ages beautifully,0.5286243516696428,0.8938
3493,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,i was really looking forward to this one pours black with a coffeeand  cream colored head huge bourbon on the nose toffee molasses and a little char in the taste been holding on to this for a while woeth the wait,0.5285928626615949,0.3182
3116,Framboos,i had the 14 no carb but still a wonderful beer to try still very delicate and fruity even if the stillness of the beer can be a bit distracting if youre looking for something more effervescent,0.5285465873423147,0.5251
2020,Keene Idea,finally was able to track this one down thanks to good beer friends definitely one of alpines best nice citrus notes and a solid hoppy finish enjoyed the 64 oz growler with friends at a bachelor party share,0.5284901524332639,0.9826
1628,Focal Banger,its a toss up as to which i prefer this or heady topper only had one so i drank it from the can so the appearance rating is an assumption beyond that though the aroma amazing the citra and mosaic hops play well together and the british malts dont hurt the taste is really good very nice ipa nice hop bitterness but doesnt diminish the flavor well done the feel well is subjective of course but i think this one was excellent for the genre oa  yum happy to have been able to try this,0.5284852268745636,0.9761
492,Very Green,canned on 3112021 six days ago  what a score  pours a super hazy dirty straw color with over a finger of head the nose has notes of citrus overrippened tropical fruits and a touch of darkness in the back end is this what they meant by green  the flavor has really bold tropical fruits up front with a bitter and pithy finish  the bitterness is apparent but not turned up to 11 nevertheless this is a modern day classic  anyone who asks why tree house beers are so special this is the beer to hand them,0.5283945040855215,0.8494
808,Blessed,i went in to this beer expecting a barleywine because anchorage  but i was pretty confused when it hit my tongue loads of rich thick milk chocolate vanilla and coconut the bourbon and oak are understated but there  id like a bit more so that the diabeetus juice doesnt quite overwhelm it but its still fantastic i wish id bought a few bottles of this  blessed be the friend who shared with me,0.5283692622706887,0.989
5336,Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,this one honestly elevates above stout and is in a class of its own i realize there are adjuncts to this one but they blend so well it tastes more like all the flavors are natural malt and yeast derived ive probably had 2000 different stouts and this one makes my mount rushmore,0.5281362739893967,0.917
2230,Triple Shot,yup this is where its at i had this on draft at tree house in march 2020 i had tried double shot w vanilla bean before and absolutely loved it this had what youd expect from the name  just a bit more coffee flavor than double shot but still without being overpowering or too bitter one of the smoothest stouts ive ever had and popping with flavor in even the smallest sip delicious creamy mouthfeel and you didnt notice the 9 abv until after the beer was gone i actually bought a second draft alter ego w peach and doublefisted them back and forth they actually worked great together like fruit and chocolate for dessert,0.5281228991997559,0.9306
2312,Abricot Du Fermier,b2 had this side by side with 30 other tremendous apricot sours and saisons it was a damn good beer but i liked la fosse better and westly maybe it was more apricotty fresh but it was tart and good but didnt blow me out of the water either,0.5281000410726235,0.942
3533,Mocha Wednesday,figured if i was gonna solo a bottle the least i can do is write a little something  look not the darkest beer ever but pours with a good head and the bottle has one of the more elegantly designed labels imo  smell the smell is true to the name with chocolate and coffee featuring prominently smells like an understated mocha  taste i immediately taste loads of chocolate but before it becomes overly sweet it is balanced by strong coffee notes and then i think i detect some dark fruit notes as it finishes smoothly this bottle is only 34 months from bottling but the alcohol is on the 1214 level by taste which is astounding as always  feel i just had abraxas 2 days prior to drinking this and i think that the mouthfeel that perennial puts out is just completely out of this world if i hadnt just had a perennial stout this would be a 5 but clearly mouthfeel could be improved since maman  variants exist  overall favorite weekday beer so far looking forward to trying pb thursday,0.5279175570189327,0.9922
5692,Hop JuJu,l very frothy amber clear  s you can smell it from across the room  t big hop flavor that doesnt pull any punches swiming in hops may take your palate a moment to adjust it makes lake erie monster look like lake erie gecko this beer will slap your ass and call you sally  f its heavy whatever it is my favorite part is how resiny it is  o sometimes one will have a craving for super hoppy ipa and hop juju will satisfy the only problem is the availability sucks in my store i promote fatheads like i do great lakes and i have for years and im lucky if i get two cases a year,0.5278944563269143,0.9689
6207,Second Fiddle,this actually pours almost clear if you leave the last ½ ounce in the can a deep yellow color with a wispy foam and lots of lacing definitely more of a west coast style dipa than ne hazy dank and piney opens up a bit as it warms bitter but still goes down easily its one of my personal favorites and i feel is underrated available in growlers and 16 ounce cans new label in february of this year,0.5277802982887136,0.834
2824,Double Shot,serving 16 oz can poured into a goose island pint glass canned on 112719 i take my espresso very very seriously edition making this just over 3 months old at this point  a really hard not to mistake this for a ba beer pitch black gorgeous mocha head decent amount of lacing up the glass literally almost pours out like motor oil and i mean it  s nice fresh coffee up front little bit of cocoa and vanilla too  t way sweeter than i was expecting but im okay with that coffee is not a huge player here but mixes nice with heavy fudge chocolate coconut and molasses flavors  m heres where its hit out of the park this may be the best mouthfeel ive had on any stout let alone beer it is so unbelievably chewy and rich the flavors just linger for days truly truly special  o my introduction to dark beers by tree house and i am not disappointed holy smokes the mouthfeel on this is world class its not a coffeeforward coffee beer and thats okay it just shows how complex it is with all the other flavors going on ba tells me this is the 1 nonba regular stout in the world and while thats not a huge and coveted style i dont see anything near it in this class beautifully done  recommendation yes,0.527703872485707,0.9926

5815,Schaarbeekse Kriek,hearty pink liquid amazing clarity lighter pink substantial head aroma was drops heavy sour cherry notes not dark cherry bright red bitter powerful yet light cherry even with that amount a legit 9 on the 110 scale some oak still comes in  taste hits that 8 note on the scale massive cherry drop only to be rivaled by lpk from cantillon probably floats over the wheat was surprised when writing my review today to see this is now retired glad i got a few when i did high ass price tag on these but youre entitled to it on your birthday friend,0.5272143285402164,0.8607
1302,Headroom,pours thick and milky and golden just what youd expect from a wellloved trillium beer smell is grass green onion and maaaaaybe a liiiittle citrus but not enough for my liking taste is equally bitternessforward and doesnt match the flavors my eyes were expecting its nice to be reminded neipas arent all pure juice but it also reaffirms what i like in a beer great for what it is and if you like that you will love it its just not for me,0.52710880043054,0.9803
4170,Art,batch 4 bottled 5212015  appearance  pours a pale straw yellow that is slightly opaque but you can vaguely see through it its golden hue resembles more a glass of chardonnay than beer but the narrow dense snowwhite head gives it away what the head lacks in height it more than makes up for in retention as it never fully dissipates even when it finally sinks it coats nearly the entire surface with a thin film of foambubbles of carbonation lackadaisically rise to the surface every now then but they are sparse  aroma  the aroma is a blend of freshcut grass lemon peel nectarines subtle graininess and finally a burst of white grapes at the end it is altogether cohesive and summons and subtle tartness that ties everything together the fruitiness of it makes it infinitely refreshing to smell and the acidity coupled with the almost tropicallike fruit blend is nearly flawless in execution the barrel is integrated seamlessly with waves of oak vanilla and finally the wine itself washing over the other notes without overpowering them  taste  after my first sip i was surprised at how acidic art actually is compared to what i perceived in the aroma to be fair in contrast to other beers it isnt overly acidic but it came across more than i expected after a few more tries to acclimate its easier to swallow the grapelemon zest combo is still king and why not since it is so good lemongrass and the grains come next to light the load before finally the fruits emerge again to carry this to the finish the tartness kicks the flavors up to a whole new level the wine is a bit more present here and it contributes a slight booziness that oozes into the other flavors to give them that barrelkissed feeling the vanilla falls away here leaving the oak to drive home the barrel notes  mouthfeel  the mouthfeel is probably the only thing i can fault art on in my opinion i was expecting more carbonation based on the style but it falls pretty low on spectrum and a bit more wouldve made this even better otherwise this is very nice it is light on the palate and is just dry enough to make it super refreshing  closing arguments  as my first foray into hill farmsteads barrelaged program and really to the brewery itself ive never really tried many of their beers even though they are always on my radar ever since i had ephraim way back in early 2011 i didnt know what to expect with art happily i can easily proclaim this is near the top if not the top of my saison list it is flawless in almost every way besides the carbonation and i could drink this endlessly  especially in the summer heat,0.5270721115507533,0.9923

2008,Resolute - Coconut,i went through a lot to be able to acquire this beer its 600 bottle count makes it one of the true virginia whalez the pour on this beer is great with very minimal head and little to no lacing the smell is of bitter chocolate bourbon vanilla and real coconut past this the beer falls short so many people speak of this being the best smelling beer they have ever experienced without stopping to really mention the actual drinkability of it upon letting the variant warm up i got all of the soy sauce flavors reviewers complain about in dark lord the coconut flavor is barely there if present at all the mouthfeel is thick and oily leaving a bad coating behind overall this beer is way too overhyped this is likely a result of hoarders playing into the hype train to inflate the secondary market value of a mediocre beer in the end i would have paid 25 for this beer and been satisfied but i traded away way too much to get ahold of it not worth your vanilla ryes people instead enjoy a kentucky christmas morning if you have it,0.5269522131626767,0.8254
2322,Breakfast Stout,bottled 31121 this is the perfect time for a summer spring winter beer  the description on the back of the bottle pretty much tells it all it pours dark brown with a small tan head much like the coffee types it emulates smell and taste are almost identical black coffee and unsweetened chocolate there is a bit of mild oat sweetness that i get on the nose but not on the tongue the chocolate is a bit more pronounced in the taste there is a particular roasted quality in the aftertaste that i like its a cup of joe that makes you feel even better its very smooth which may be attributed to the addition of oatmeal im just reading bas description of the style at this point no alcohol heat either  i enjoy it even if it is a bit on the bitter side there just isnt anything that really grabs me,0.5269416494784535,0.9042
2627,Last Buffalo In The Park,the look and mouthfeel of this beer are world class where things falls apart is the same old story with every funky buddha beer ive tried that cheap chemical flavor from the adjuncts it tastes like the beer equivalent of fast food,0.5269310201885833,0.2732
328,Pliny The Elder,was recently out in san francisco visiting friends and had to get my hands on this legendary beer being a boston guy i am a bit biased to the neipa as the dominant ipa style but this truly is the grandfather of the genre elder you might say anyways to the beer it pours into a glowing gold with a frothy thick head that caught me off guard and escaped my glass a casualty but nonetheless we march on carbonation bubbles dance to the top of the head from the bottom of the glass to the nose pineyfloral aromas tickle your nostrils a sip and immediately you are met by a light bitterness but a very fresh hoppy and pine like taste a slight citrus aftertaste and each time you put it down you are lured quickly to the next sip slowly you are warmed by the alcohol and once gone you are left satisfied and disappointed you are out of beer id compare it to tasting somewhat like a harpoon ipa for my east coasters but definitely a more impressive beer,0.5269148562909812,0.9596
142,Pliny The Younger,500ml bottle into a tulip huge thanks to my friend scott for hooking me up with this longtime dream beer  l a finger of dense white foam atop a bright orangeamber body while far from cloudy by todays standards theres a good amount of hop haze head retention and lacing are excellent especially for such a big beer  s hugely aromatic with a complex interplay of citrus and pine the resin actually takes a back seat for me with orange and tangerine notes really jumping out not much ethanol but its definitely a big step up in intensity from pte and decidedly more fruitforward than that classic im a fan but its actually more restrained than i was anticipating i can dig that  t hops hops hops the tangerine from the nose pops right away with herbalpiney resin filling in midway through big flavorful hoppiness throughout the finish is what really shines though as the perfect amount of bitterness combines with an astonishing dryness that somehow manages not to be harsh or boozy in the least ive never had a hoppy beer this strong that was even in the same ballpark of drinkability i could happily drink several pints of this dangerous delicious stuff  f on the light side of mediumbodied with a perfect level of soft carbonation and a mouthwatering dryness excellent  o through no fault of its own this beer is almost inevitably overrated no matter how good it actually is its very very very good there were elements of it that were truly striking and definitely put it on the shortlist for best in its style but at no point did i feel like i was having the best beer of my life which is pretty much what the pedigree and legend demand for it not to be disappointing i fully expected that going in though so i was much more impressed and appreciative than anything else pty is a justifiably famous brew and i hope to get the change to enjoy it again someday  cheers,0.5269110864540659,0.9988
3504,Imperial Biscotti Break - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,met expectations almost exactly lovely flavors but a touch artificially sweet not much character to it but it goes deep on that chocolate cake flavor so it winds up being rather enjoyable worth buying if you see it not really worth seeking out,0.5269073049385447,0.8789

980,Chemtrailmix,wowza this was the 2018 edition such a big boy beer poured like thick black motor oil nose was subtle but indicative of the lusciousness to come will definitely have to seek out other vintages a top tier stout for me,0.526692604124334,0.8201
5394,Very HHHazyyy,can dated 33021 drank on 4621  l  golden orange cant get much better in this category  s  a bit muted imo but improves as the beer warms sweet peach  t  th describes it as overipe peach and i think that hits the nail on the head also notes of tropical fruit but at 9 definetly can taste the booze on the back end which took a bit away for me  f  classic treehouse fluffy and soft moderate carbonation  o  a very good beer that has all the treehouse characteristics just wish it wasnt approaching 9 as i think it comes through a little too much,0.5266876313540619,0.9612
1270,King Sue,well this was one expensive fourpack six bucks higher than the pseudosue i had no idea it would be one of the top ipas i just like the fossil sue so i spent money i didnt have and here we are  and i think well damn its pretty friggin good they werent screwing around here oily resinous hops abound thick and chewey like a meal of hops lingering dry bitterness in the throat  kinda makes you feel like a giant nonavian therapod with a hankering for lawyers,0.5264904334148249,0.8992
4067,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,regardless of opinion on this brewery socially to me their dark stuff is so far amazing the coffee is super background here but the chocolate and bourbon flavor is excellent maple is subtle as well but i wasnt surprised there overall it was a quality product,0.5264845671777766,0.8931
2619,Last Buffalo In The Park,tried the 2017 which was one of the best porters ive ever had great all around nose balance mouthfeel flavor profile and finish wonderful fresh and still great a couple of years later,0.5262896755448573,0.9607
1313,Headroom,headroom has been a wishlist beer for a couple of years now  as with other trillium offerings ive only sporadically been able to nail down trades were only talking about ipas here  but they can still be confoundingly difficult to locate  headroom strangely fell in to my lap via a friend this 2018 release can was a very pleasant surprise  the beer pours a light orange  the nose is soft and fruity and very pleasant mouthfeel is rich  in a blind test i might very easily misidentify this beer as a milkshake ipa its surprisingly really  its just super thick and yeasty and malty its also tremendously sweet and soft which i think may be the unfortunate source of the slight lingering and unpleasant aftertaste it could definitely use a bit of a cleaner finish id also have to add that its just a bit boozy  the abv isnt really discernible per se but its certainly a little hotter than your standard 8 ipa i like and do not like this about the beer id really like it to be a little more sessionable  but thats my personal bias and i havent factored that in to my ratings  headroom is a fantastic beer  ill admit that id prefer a lot more ddh fort point in my life but lacking the option id very definitely take some headroom,0.5262830866577924,0.9923
4167,Art,awesome beer wine barrel present expands on what i love about arthur soft citrus presence makes me want more and more of this would bang again,0.5262742337429299,0.875
4741,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,this is everything it says on the bottle  its definitely a porter and a gorgeous one at that with a body that verges in black with mahogany on the edges and a dense light tan head and the maple literally grabs you by the throat when you pop the top on the bottle  and then the coffee jumps in and theres an earthy salty note as well  the maple and coffee are the leads on the taste but the star is the salty flavor that comes with some chocolate and char notes the mouthfeel approaches creamy which is to style with this nonimperial porter  this may be the best beer ive had in 2020 and possibly back to 2019 its breakfast in a beer and is truly a pleasure to drink,0.5262121663461936,0.9682
3740,Upper Case,very light for its abv doesnt have the nose of some of trilliums other ipas and is lighter in body than expected for the abv the flavor is there notes of mango and pineapple abound it might just need a bit more time in the can for the nose to burst free  i will revisit if that is the case for now this is a solid offering with a sneaky light feel for such a big beer i remember when 91 implied triple,0.5261776152203262,0.4588
2758,Mexican Brunch, 112117  on tap at brewery  a little disappointed a nice medium spicy stout but lacking the thickness and superior flavor of sunday brunch   020819  on tap at uno  409 up to 430 this sample is better than my previous   050519  happy cinco de mayo after sampling the 2019 batch 3 times once on tap twice from bottles i am convinced that this version is better than the 2017 batch i had great flavors and aromas  this was side by side with the bba mexican brunch the bba is smoother but maybe tamps down some of the flavor as well it will probably land a similar overall rating    ,0.5261727686459962,0.9856
513,Zenne Y Frontera,decanted at 3f perhaps the perfect allaround lambic drinking experience visually stunning amazing bouquet taste was incredibly well balanced blends 3 5 and 6 were all great but 3 was my favorite,0.5261114215359188,0.9152

1287,King Sue,poured the look and color of raw honey with an almost white head which leaves copious amounts of lacing the aroma was wonderful i could actually smell it the citra hops are well represented here no doubt citrus and mango and maybe pineapple the taste wow this can was packaged 42321 so i have to wonder what it is like fresh but as it was it was one of the best double ipas i have ever had certainly the best in the neipa category the feel awesome smooth and soft and just too easy to drink i will be keeping my eye out for this in hopes of finding fresh releases in michigan,0.526069302411989,0.9904
171,Mornin' Delight,to start i would like to say this was purchased on tap at a local bottle shop doing pours and crowlers i may change this after i open the crowler but this review is based solely off the 10 oz pour i had at the release with that being said it was quite cold off the initial pour  look poured thick jet oily black the beer itself has zero light coming though the body a slight amount on the top outer edge the head is a very dark mocha brown with medium sized bubbles the head hangs around for a good 48 minutes the glass lacing is amazing thick lines of dark brown bubbles hang around on the glass  smell the aroma is fresh boiled maple syrup that high sugar fresh maple syrup that slowly as this beer warmed in the glass it explodes with notes of coffee the syrup is kind of overwhelmingly there throughout the beer the sweetness is so sugar like i cant really say it vanilla as the beer rises in temperature though the heavy sent of fresh ground espresso comes through nicely  taste the flavor profile is where this beer shined for me up front big espresso notes a very nice bitterness followed by an amazing sweetness the back end of my pallet picked up ever possible maple flavor possible maple candy and homemade fresh maple syrup it is a very sweet beer in all honesty though i really enjoy how the coffee notes mellow that out the finish of beer you a greeted with a nice touch of vanilla  feel the first sip this beer was not as thick as expected it was poured quite cold as it warmed and i sipped on it it became what seemed thicker i mean this is a thick beer do not misunderstand what i am saying but i just expected it to be thicker maybe out of a bottle it is  overall being 22 years old i can say ive been super gifted with the beers i have been lucky enough to get my hands on since i got into craft beer early last year this has been in my top 10 wants for a while i had a very high mental standard of how good this beer should be it more than lived up to the hype i was very lucky in being able to try this beer on tap it really is all the best parts of breakfast in a bottle this is a god tier beer for me absolutely outstanding,0.5260520665202457,0.9988
4392,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,disappointed the apple brandy didnt work for me with this dark base stout it was also pretty thin in mouthfeel especially for this brand i much prefer bomb pirate bomb or birthday bomb to this one,0.5259789044351282,-0.8316
1143,V.S.O.J.,thanks to intecwrx for this 12 oz can my very special old jacket was my first black leather motorcycle jacket which protected me from my first motorcycle crash it looked bad ass with those skid marks across the right shoulder my shoulder not so much  the pour is very dark brown with shanda fay highlights nose is surprisingly weak  or is that subtle  with dark fruit  what id assume was brandy if i couldnt read  vsoj how is this not brandy barrel aged because thats what i get rich alcohol dark fleshy fruit caramel brown sugar sharp oak molasses damn theres a lot going on in here sticky denser than michael a name redacted like fay once in a night is enough  yet another beer that falls into the after dinner liqueur category jacket is decadent like a 007 yacht less the considerable hype this is still an excellent beer,0.5259159943528521,0.9184
948,Fuzzy,had a 4oz pour at a bottleshare look wasnt anything crazy but the smell was so complex showcasing barrelfunk and loads of peaches in perfect balance the taste was both jammy and some dryness in the back the feel was medium and effervescent overall a great ba fruited wild ale that i hope i can get my own bottle to share with the wife,0.5258536539572966,0.9631
6176,The Streets,16oz can received through the generosity of jay orear according to the stamp on the bottom of the can this was canned on march 10 2021 this is the absolute last of many beers that he sent me as part of the most recent nbs bif  poured into the glass this was an opaque pale yellow with a fluffy beige colored head lots of lace  citrusy and tropical fruit aromas and a kind of milky aroma like a creamsicle with a little added stonefruiy element was this brewed with lactose  now that im reading up on this beer im pretty sure no lactose was used it still tastes like it was to me nevertheless im also getting a kind of sweet strawberrylike fruitiness up front in the taste that isnt so clear in the nose theres also a little bit of heat  not really so surprising in a 10 abv beer  that stands out a little here that wasnt apparent in the nose that heat would make it kinda rough to knock out a bombers worth but this can is the right amount finishes bright fruity and sweet  creamy mouthfeel again it seems like lactose was used went it wasnt what sort of sorcery is this  no way in hell i could session this nor should anyone really as thats not whats meant here its delicious though and i would absolutely drink this again thanks jay,0.5258322727986063,0.956
449,Juice Machine,l a dark cantaloupe purée with a finger of beige foam fading to a wide climbing ring and tiny specks of lacing  s smells of mango oranges and evergreens  t follows the nose with a decent addition of papaya  f smooth with a medium to heavy weight and juicy mouthfeel  o holding a 471 i expected to be blown away on all levels for example what criteria are folks using to give the look a 5 i wonder as this looks barely over average for the style this was a good brew for sure but in a large and ever more competent crowd,0.5258092355892513,0.7899
1338,Cable Car,what a great surprise to get to try this at toronado during duck days of summer 2016 vintage poured into a goblet it is a beautiful goldenorange color with a slight haze and 1 finger of head smells was most stone fruit peaches apricots a bit of lemon big creamy body with the right amount of dryness acidity mild and tart  funk i know they price point turns some folks off but i considered this a treat and a beer id probably never have again so 60 seemed well worth it to me if i do get another chance to drink this again i wont hesitate,0.5257806851419408,0.9532
1017,Zombie Dust,in a can 6 weeks since being packaged some pine maybe a hint of whiskey and leather some citrus but not a juice bomb the mouthfeel was pretty heavy the overall flavor had a slight astringent note to the immediate finish im not tasting the same world renowned brew that has been exalted here but i would pay 12 for a six again just not the 15 i originally paid,0.5256759064742312,0.7988
4904,Aurelian Lure,from a 4 oz tasting of batch 3 cloudy but representative apricot color and the fruit comes through on the nose in a nice reserved way and then the taste stays right in step with the pace and expectation of the leadin im not a fan of sours and citrusforward beers so this sweeter fruit theme is more to my liking and is a beautiful offering for the type,0.5256660126446014,0.9109
3479,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,250ml bottle first try in 2009 a 2006 vintage i cant deny that i had very high expectations and really wanted for it to fulfill them did it  hell yeah  2006 bottle served in a wonderful de molen snifter it pours pitch black thick and oily in the glass creating a small but wonderful deep brown head the wonderful roasted aroma with the coffee and chocolate notes and a slight hint of vanilla tar and wood so complex and as it warms it becomes even better but nothing can prepare you for the taste that is about to follow the roasted malts coffee chocolate wood notes some distant ripe fruit so many flavors  so wonderfully balanced together what really amazes me though is how easily it drinks despite its abv you feel like you can have in my dreams many many glasses which is rarely the case with big imp stouts i cant give it anything but a perfect score and i really doubt that i will do this for another beer certainly hope so though d   having had this on many more occasions and in many vintages my original rating hasnt changed a bit i wish i could drink this every day,0.5256569638621323,0.9958
3050,Cable Car Kriek,so excited to try this beer i walked into sd toronado the superior toronado of the two while i was on my birthday vacation and was shocked to see this sitting in the cooler yes it was sitting in the coolerfor all to see no asking the bartenders if they have it just to let them decide if they like you enough to serve it to you this toronado does it how it should be such great service outstanding food and great beer selection back to the kriekit poured a lot less pink than i thought it would be it was a clouded lightred color with an offwhite head scent is very cherryforward with some definite barnyard and musty aromas the smell is so darn inviting i cant help but take few sips of this beer immediately the cherry is so profound in this beer more than i expected a good amount of oak and funk not overly acidic whatsoeverin fact not very acidic at all just a clean funky fruity wild ale mouthfeel is medium bodied almost puckering with a juicy finish sour and juicy equals amazing in my book drinkability is very high overall this beer was worth every penny i spent on it i went into the night willing to spend 80 on the bottle just to find out it was 55 so worth it a phenomenal wild ale,0.5256178274327014,0.9822

778,Morning Wood,i got this in a trade and the date is smudged off   appearance poured 14th of a glass every time so not too much head pitch black of course some lacing  aroma impressive  maple coffee and smoke all shine through  flavor overall sweet almost like a milk stout maple syrup throughout strong coffee throughout as well milk chocolate the barrels come through if you pay attention theres a slight smokiness on the back end which is such a great addition there is absolutely no heat the advertised flavors do not lie however i dont get much more than that not a bad thing but perhaps was hoping for more  palatefinish medium but oily and sticky very smooth no carb i do wish this was thicker but i also realize that this is a porter so i wont knock it too much finishes with more coffee and sticky maple  overall this is a very good beer and it deserves some accolade i was hoping for something to chew on but at the same time the style is porter and i do admire that the alcohol is completely hidden and the maplecoffee flavors shine so well in the flavor and in the aroma this is what impressed me most on the other hand its not the most complex imperial porter ive had and its a little lactosy overall im gonna say this is an a beer but not an a,0.5252899447808927,0.9903
0,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,long time waiting to tick this one and i have to say  pretty underwhelmed its delicious as far as maple syrup goes but overall it was lacking in complexity barrel was light and not much else nice mouth feel and long finish,0.5252825046532082,0.1159

5624,Space Trace,like a liquid mounds bar the aromas are subtle but definitely there from the glass the magic really happens on the palette the chocolate and coconut come through perfectly and are backed up by the smooth base beer barrel comes though but only just enough to complement the beer and bring everything together,0.5251327258444505,0.9052
345,Pliny The Elder,a solid double west coast ipa that is smoother than most i get the hype behind this beer but i dont find it as enticing as other double ipas not my favorite from russian river brewing but definitely a powerful beer,0.5250631298255272,0.652

5433,Flora,florence is probably my favorite shelf saison beer from hf so its no wonder this one is amazing it takes everything from the regular and amps it up with a nice tartness and oak character screams that hf signature funk with a bit of lemonlime character as well,0.5248391363627721,0.7918
5640,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,back as pitch with a thin and light tan head wonderfully rich coffee on the nose less bourbon than typical for the brewery but still added to the otherwise simplistic brew this is in my top two or three for certain though as what it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in execution and refinement,0.5248290676885237,0.8225
6154,Bourbon Barrel Black Maple,2019 batch drank fairly fresh significantly better than the 20152016 batches which had a faint of maple  not overly sweet but just enough of maple with the barrel presence if it was more richfull body would be a knockout the thinness detracts from being an awesome brew   overall jo barrel aging is good but is clearly the best when drank fresh having several bottles that have been gifted to friends these are not to be aged,0.5248260534339589,0.9831
2691,Notorious Triple IPA,wow usually double ipas are too strong for me this is a triple ipa and yet it is delicious it is incredibly strong but you have to expect that its like drinking port if port was really really good and tasted like an excellent ipa,0.524727995479026,0.9763
1759,Ephraim,i dont generally love hoppy beers that are over 85 because theyre too heavy and sweet and this one is just those things hill beers have unrivaled mouthfeel and elegance and this is just overdone intended im sure given that its 10 but id take most of the hill single and double ipas over ephraim,0.5247269330516845,0.3645
1678,Society & Solitude #4,pouring this beer from a 12 oz can into a snulip glass this beer pours out like a thick sunny d bright orange it forms a pinky width of white creamy crown that leaves slight lacing  before even putting my nose to the glass i smell juice its a really delightful clean juice a lot like sunny d itself clean and bright citrus presence like orange juice tangerine  the taste follows suit well this thing is a little one dimensional with the citrus juice but its so good at what it does that you cant fault it for it sunny d just keeps coming to mind so clean  the mouthfeel has a slight and balanced citrus tang to it its soft somewhat creamy but not a hugely thick creamy and clean all the way through no burn just smooth clean ness  overall man i see why this thing is a legend as previously stated its a little one dimensional but that one dimensional is awesome and every aspect of it is screaming clean from the front to the back the looks to the feel this thing is hotter than my first pistol that i bought in the hood when i was 15,0.5246990586732163,0.992
2042,Black Note Stout,2017 vintage pours jet black smallmedium head  aroma is full of roast taste is roast and chocolate with a bit of barrel hanging on  the beer is still smooth but if you have any left from 17 drink them now they wont age any better in my opinion,0.524650165552387,-0.4782
2037,Keene Idea,this is like nelson on crack so delicious barely noticeable abv one alpine beer you know youre getting from their production and not green flash must try another winner from alpine,0.5245464331884274,0.9009
1557,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),2017 green wax  l look is of regular dark lord dark with a slight khaki minimal head that quickly dissipated  s again same as regular dl where is the barrel dark fruit sugary and sweet  t it was like drinking regular dark lord there was a very faint barrel presence but it tasted like normal dl overly sweet sugary and dark fruit  f medimum body wich was about the best attribute the beer had going for itself  o the 17 vintage does not live up to past representations of the beer lacks barrel and would seek out others before this one wish i would have traded this one away,0.5243957754873728,0.9696
4174,Art,purchased one year ago at the source pours a cloudy yellow aroma is super funky taste largely follows as it warms it becomes much better not sure i get much wine barrel in this,0.5243674640301959,0.7606
6057,Black & Wild,was surprised that i got to try this beer batch 1 shared at the sp brewery 1 year anniversary pours a dark reddish hue with not a ton of carb i didnt pick up on much more than the cherry on the nose flavor was pretty intense which was a bit of a surprise given the age of the bottle a nice robust tart cherry flavor on the palate i didnt get a lot of the barrel but that couldve been from all the other insane beers i was having at the time,0.5242889392356679,0.4588

634,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),after waiting for many years to try this beer it was very good but not the best quadrupel ive ever had it has some nice dark fruit fig date raisin notes but its surprisingly boozy i no longer feel a need to acquire a case for aging purposes,0.5242793462317955,0.063
1286,King Sue,i was surprised when saw king sue on tap in a local bar ordered a pint  it was served in a frosted pint glass as you know this is a renouned beer rated 100 on ba and  49 in the top rated beer list have to say it lives up to its hype this beer is an orange gold color with a thick white lasting head very complex aroma of citrus pine and herbs the taste is also complex but is so well blended that nothing stands out full mouthfeel and a finish that matches the aroma king sue is just about the best hazy ipa i have ever tasted i asked for an unfrosted glass for my 2ond pint,0.5242701274002686,0.9054
5950,Peche 'n Brett,very nice beer carb complemented the beer well and it was very refreshing the star of the show was clearly the peaches they came through very well and worked excellent with the base beer,0.5241372026812989,0.9183
997,Chemtrailmix,i had five of the variants on dld and this was by far the best the taste is a mild cinnamon toast crunch with a great balance of the peppercorns this is a world class stout very silky if you can get it get it,0.5239548745541792,0.875
3268,Bomb!,bought on a recommendation at blackbeards crafts on sawtelle this one surprised me everything in it is subservient to the cacao the vanilla stands in for sugar the coffee offers bitterness where the malty stout would itself refuse to it does really remind you of a milkshake but not quite because of any desserty cloying sweetness its the viscosity the halfandhalf mouthfeel that delivers the vanilla and cacao while somehow sneaking in a full 12 or 13 percent abv when you can barely even register the burn mine poured into a snifter with no head and barely even the sound of fizziness and on the nose its pure dessert chocolate milk or devils food cake i try not to inhale too much as i drink it because i want to catch the ancho chili and the beer in a way that the aroma doesnt carry usually this is not my kind of thing i dont like foreign flavors as a dominant element and i like for a fine food to carry more layers or maybe more variance between its layers bomb instead wields its complexity in a way that focuses your attention onto that single 65percentcacao sensory simulacrum making you wonder how this is even beer  i wanted to finish by saying that i respect this beer but didnt plan to buy another unfortunately for me this beer feels like a perfect match for some of my favorite domestic blue cheeses rogue creamerys exquisite caveman blue sings in the same key as this stout and i have no choice but to try them together,0.5238352140105699,0.8223
4113,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,kids always bring back trillium when you visit boston like you didnt know that 16 oz can dated 10418  the pour is thick phlegmlike yellow that smells like grapefruit perfume cut with pine not bad  mosaic dry hopped fort point leans hard enough into grapefruit it might fall out of the car grapefruit for kilometers kiwi spring florals touch of mint with a nice bitter finish dry easy enough to drink which might be its calling card  i cant speak for the masses but i will anyways but this appears to be a classic case of this is trilllllliumitis a good solid beer but nothing to rise above many others especially with all the genuinely excellent beers in their portfolio,0.523765631397234,0.9374
4547,Impermanence,poured from a 16oz can dated 121919 to a diagonally cut tumbler this is an extremely dark black beer you only get a hint of brown in the pour stream a minimal suggestion of a head rings the glass even with an aggressive pour and this despite what appears to be moderate carbonation i think that has to do with the viscosity see mouth feel below maple and caramel hit the nose but not super strong the taste is another matter complex and powerful flavors to analyze its sweet all ingredients listed on the label present themselves one after another as if designed to take turns 1chocolate 2maple 3 caramel 4 coffee the maple almost gives a barrelaged impression despite this not being aged i could almost say there is an illusion of smoke mouth feel is right up there with the taste like thinned maple syrup if i could make this thicker by boiling it down i would put it on pancakes maybe that would be a waste of a fantastic beer but it sounds kind of interesting right now as i pause in writing this my lips are sticking together i like bitter and dry stouts better than sweet ones but for this one i will make an exception fantastic,0.523682846970595,0.9699
220,King JJJuliusss,canned 10120 tasted 102820 a superhyped beer that was certainly delicious but didnt quite reach the pinnacle i was expecting the look was not superappetizing because it had a muddled orangebrown color  i found the brighter look of king julius or jjjuliusss to be much more appealing the smell was excellent though  very rich and enticing the taste was very good but not incredible  it had a slight sourness to it that i wasnt a huge fan of it definitely has a touch more bitterness and grassy hop character than kj or jjjsss which may appeal to some palates but in my view it detracted from what made those other beers stand out the feel was good but not as fluffy or creamy as some other th dipas,0.5236805091364916,0.9691
1640,Focal Banger,from a 16 ounce can dated 12102020 a short pour gets a yellow hazy straw color had a fabulous head on the second pour i tried it straight from the can too its aroma favors an almost skunky citrus smell that is very inviting the taste is grapefruit lemon orange and the right amount of bitterness that wanes as you drink more the mouthfeel is smooth and refreshing straight from the can this is truly a fine neipa i hope i get the chance to try it again a special thanks to laketang for the heads up on getting this focal banger and a couple more in the process that i dont normally get in texas i will admit i enjoyed it more poured in the proper glassware the aroma is extra special 24jan2021,0.5235810634335335,0.98
4008,The Abyss,has anyone ever said i cannot wait to drink this glass of what looks like boiled motor oil well motor oil comes out of the container looking more like an ipa so that adjective oily never seemed correct dirty motor oil i guess if my car ran on the abyss i would do much more walking and biking its dark like an abyss wow ironic it smells like cocoa malt candy joy it smells like jamaican blue mountain if it was half as good as they say the taste absolutely follows its all been said before malty chocolate caramel licorice dark fruit heaven its good theres some alcohol in that taste however more than most are willing to say you guys try that french toast version thats around in 2021 odd add cinnamon and maple to the above and you have it its good as i have said here before better does exist bba darkness for example but abyss is lovely,0.5235019542121694,0.9709
700,KBS,bottled 102220 gorgeous beer poured it into a wine glass my preference for stronger beers and it was almost as delightful to look at as it was to taste big beautiful brown head coffee is the prominent note in this chocolate taking second place top notch stout i see what the hype is all about,0.5234995346080111,0.9573

1669,Society & Solitude #4,what complexity on the dryer side despite the rich tropical elements in a sense more restrained but so tightly woven packed with flavors and layers that listing them would be silly just an incredible beer with perfect craftsmanship,0.5233228426358744,0.6842

2305,Abricot Du Fermier,abricot du fermier batch 3 is beautiful its what you hope for based on its name glowing bright yellow smooth and even soft looking a fluffy white cloud is perched above the bright sunshine from below and its making me thirsty  cracked wheat and an acidic sour aroma is complimented not overpowered by wonderful levels of oak and the star of this show the sweet juicy apricots cut grass hay and more sunshine as if wet wooden panels are being steamed by it in the morning its complex yet beautifully simple  and the flavors are even better i can almost say they are identical but the texture must play a factor here as it is velvety soft and carries them remarkably everything you could ask for in a rustic wild saison tart but not puckering light but not something to guzzle and full of all the right flavors of wood hay wheat bread crusts barn funk and in this case the simple introduction of apricot  this is a delicious beverage one that i never even knew i wanted to try but couldnt be more excited once i laid eyes on this bottle i knew it was something special and it is i want more if you can get it consider yourself lucky and do so cheers,0.5230688867344669,0.987
3014,Wide Awake It's Morning,looks exceptionally creamy  doesnt smell much more involved than founders breakfast stout or peche mortel  taste it shines lots and lots of maple though not a lot  the evident hop presence is extremely uncondusive to the character of this beer  m  rich and foamy good stuff  overall i dig it not blown away by it but its solid wouldnt put it in the top 250 and cant see myself revisiting it but worth once i suppose,0.5230133915732903,0.8422

1189,Double Galaxy,picked up a 6 pack of this at the source in late october what a fun day that was  pours a cloudy yellow with 13 white head good retention for style has the nice galaxy smell pineapple definitely the most prominent tropical fruit note  taste is easy like sunday morning below average bitterness below average hop burnacidity above average tropical fruit notes still lead by the pineapple quotient malt bill is minimal and non descript outside of the normal parameters of pale malt 2 row and flaked oats relatively soft mouth feel because of all that 8 drinks pretty easy here the difference in a decade between imperial ipas to now so much different less bitterness and alcohol burn to say the least  holy moly look at that average score while i think this is a very good beer damn there are literally more than a hundred doubleimperial ipas that are just as good in california alone happy i got to try it but if you havent dont feel like its some grail that has to happen dont fomo this you have something like it around you with that said still very tasty,0.5228194033604174,0.9534
2253,The Broken Truck,for how hyped up this particular one is it is nowhere near my favorite beer from de garde so far and frankly nowhere near the objective best if thats not nitpicking at this point all of them being so fantastic i love the story of this but from the bottle it didnt blow me away to the extent that some of their others have especially some of the fruited ones its really sour more acidic than i remember most of them being and that slows down drinkability a bit for sure even with the amazing carbonation soft round mouthfeel and relative dryness to finish its still just a slow sipper for me which is probably how lambic should be anyway but its sour enough to be harsh in the belly and thats over the line for my preferences perhaps this is a product of it being in the bottle too long being a lambic type i was in no rush to open it but not all of these age favorably apparently the yeast profile under the acid is fantastic musty bretty and funky with distinct juicy fruitiness to it white wine apricots even ripe pears its rustic and interesting but with the acid its pretty aggressive the oak is sturdy here too grounding and dense all the way through which i really like it seems sort of oddly hoppy like they definitely didnt use hops aged down to zero alpha acid and if they did there are some weird organic compounds in the mix here somehow its got like a fruity linger in the finish i dont normally associate with the style despite the developed brett and heavy wood this doesnt seem as mature to me as i would have expected for something modeled on gueuze with the different vintages in the blend less of the iodine medicinal character than the old world ones bring and less of the hayloft agricultural harvest rustic character this is almost too refined to fit that bill not a criticism just a commentary i think id like it more if the sourness were less and dont get me wrong i still love it but i would take a great many of their other beers before i took this one in a hypothetical draft of their best beers always a treat to have their stuff though and i can safely cross off this bucket list brew for now  edit this was leagues better the second time around for me less acidity a lot more nuance to the wild yeast profile and with a fresh hoppy character to it at the end tons of white wine elderflower and even white peach its goegeous and was a standout from a heavy session of amazing beers not sure why it didnt taste like this the first time around but i hve a raise a few scores to reflect how good it was this time huge thanks to my buddy for sharing his bottle,0.5227965399365191,0.9983
4410,Hopslam Ale,anytime i get a chance to buy hopslam i immediately stock up on it the high alcohol taste is masked by the smooth bitterness the taste isnt completely overwhelming and goes down smooth,0.5227416429352252,-0.1779
2679,Black Tuesday - Reserve,popped this bottle at an epic omaha nebraska bottle share poured into a teku i felt this was a little over hyped drinkability was nice for a 21er better than black tuesday mouthfeel was lacking a bit not worth going out of your way for imo,0.5226878188043599,0.7379
4055,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,12 oz bottle poured into a stout glass at 40 degrees f and allowed to warm during consumption bottle date is october 2020 and i purchased this out of a walkin cooler at a bottle shop this very weekend  l pours your typical impenetrably dark stout color and forms a massive fluffy head of tan foam with excellent retention  s straight up maple fudge as in almost exactly what one expects to inhale when walking into a fudge shop in the northern us or canada id honestly be hardpressed to find any beer scent in the nose per se  t ah theres the actual beer while the maple fudge notes are distinct and prominent the underlying black bread char and coffee roll through as well the barrel notes manifest late in the tasting process and linger in the aftertaste  f oddly light for kbs thinner than one might expect  o usually of late i find myself typing something like nice but i prefer  in reviews like this this one actually bucks that trend for me this is tasty stuff,0.5226788711848277,0.9348
514,Zenne Y Frontera,batch 2 so this was the solera little bit darker orange great head great aroma of lambic and bright citrus along with some barrel i could not pick out the sherry but could tell this was a different type of barrel then your standard lambic foederbarrel that just has wood character to be honest it really reminded me of boon vat 109 which is a great compliment to both beers this was great thankful to have a set of the new releases,0.5226517736310522,0.9872
3805,Susan,a classic from these guys that i am only finally getting to drink now it may have been a game changer when it first came out but it certainly isnt anything new anymore this balance of heavy dry hopping over a hazy base with some substance is now everywhere and even the hop profile itself seems somewhat classic more northwestern than southern hemisphere but its the degree of refinement that has me blown away which is more manifest in the mouthfeel than anywhere else in this now famous ipa it is both expressively carbonated and bone dry while also being drinkable but substantial round medium body but fast finishing the right elements of the hops linger too no vegetal bite or over bittered harshness it does have some bitterness though not all juice and the grapefruity piney flavors almost assuredly simcoe derived do have some resolution but its the between the lines nuances of pineapple papaya and juniper that turn me on here so alive from the tap almost chuggable for what it is probably ahead of its time when it was introduced not decidedly in the middle of whats hot but this is a quality league or two above just about everything else including the other ones the nerds all line up for and freak out about from a flavor standpoint its great but not revolutionary but through the lens of quality its as good as it gets,0.5226370006540444,0.8559
5703,Fort Point Pale Ale,nice looking beer thick luscious appeal it has citrus elements and finishes dry and more bitter than one might expect from its appearance but i found this to be a rather nondescript ipa and then i see its actually a pale ale maybe all pale ales are just nondescript ipas nothing outstanding nothing that id really think twice about i was shocked to see the score of 99 my can was a month old so im going to attribute its lackluster appeal to that,0.5225564406811213,-0.814
241,SR-71,at the toppling goliath new brewery opening got a pretty large pour dark chocolate fudge and bourbon overall an amazing beer that i was very fortunate to be able to have,0.5225243365570916,0.8805
3186,Great,this is truly a great experience i would not classify this as an american barleywine but an english one ive never had the base but the barrel transforms this into such a smooth and sweet tasting masterpiece the alcohol is also masterfully hidden there are no hoppy notes at all,0.5224728332285831,0.9072
2844,Samuel Adams Utopias,its the port wine of the beer world well sort of it drinks more like a liquor than a beer no carbonation no creamy head just a viscous high alcohol punch in the sinuses its a great beer to experience if you can get enough folks to split the cost because this bottle aint cheap,0.5224377924904083,0.8263
951,Ann,my long time white whale we meet at last  as we slowly worked through a collection of hill bottles this evening we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions the progression is beautifully subtle while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark ann has much less visible carbonation than anna with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body this has closer to a honey appearance whereas anna is a hazier paler yellow with a larger fluffier white head  the aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than i was expecting delivering a delicate experience that is less funky yet more woody white grape riesling wine and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry falling off the palate quickly theres a hint of green olive and its only mildly sour with essentially no funkiness at all this is possibly the most winelike experience ive gotten out of a beer so much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare it even sweetens up over time  ann is absurdly refined and complex yet exceedingly simple it does not have the body of the other wonderful farmstead beers and while i love it i think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is as well as all the other hf shelfies which are just so supple easy to enjoy and complex in their own right  bottled 2015 released 2019 thanks stanley,0.5224239548518353,0.9845
2255,The Broken Truck,this bottle came out of left field  a tremendous and very welcome surprise one of the newer members of our share group is a form member of the urban family team and has a deep selection of brewery bottles and west coast stuff  including apparently this specific bottle  the beer pours a light gold mostly transparently with a hugely funky nose its fairly sour and funky with a medium mouth feel and a bit of tartness slightly acetic though my stomach had been suffering all evening long from sours the finish does not linger so its fairly pleasantly clean  fantastic  this stands up to hype and reputation im quite thankful having been able to try it,0.5223946629035745,0.9485
713,KBS,purchased at local meijer store for about 16 for a 4 pack pricey but as of this writing it is rated 100 while my fav dragons milk is 91 wish i could do this live but here it unfolds as it happens taken from frig very small pfftt as i pop the cap pours into glassvery dark colorhead and legs like marilyn monroenice but getting old aroma a bit malty but my sniffer pretty much got snuffed decades ago carbonation tingles the tongue chocolate is there but not a willy wonka dream one reviewer claims it improves as it warms so ill try to resist guzzling for now but its good stuff definitely smoother as it warms and more bourbon and coffee flavors getting frothy as i swirl it in mouth given its a breakfast stout would probably be good with pancakes definitely better as it heats to room temperature  or at 12 abv maybe its me feed the cats they love it when i sit on the floor beer warms some more chocolate seems more pronounced now only a few swigs leftwill be sorry to see it go  overall definitely an experience great brew although questionable if it beats my fav quaff certainly leaves you with a buzz a once yearly indulgence  on my budget worth doing again,0.522372107050631,0.9967

823,Blessed,opened for no good reason other than to have a fresh tasting poured cellar temp moderately fast to a tulip glass color is menacing deep dark opaque brownblack forget about any head this stuff comes out thick like oil leaving a heavy trail on the glass as its moved nose is very sweet vanilla with a mix of subtle coconut first sips are heavy on the vanilla not cloying seemingly balanced by the coconut and heavy malt foundation the bourbon is aromatic with your nose in the glass brings a tiny harmonic presence in the sip but then really comes to roost once the sip is gone im nursing these sips considering the absurd price point but a mouth full puts the whole symphony into action the mouthfeel is extremely thick which i always enjoy though i deducted a small amount wondering if a little lighter might have opened up the profile moreit could just as easily be a 5 the alcohol has no bite whatsoever totally smooth at all points its so thick and bombastic i could see pouring this over some fresh whole bean vanilla ice cream oh that would be good on a hot night like tonight this is usually a cold dead of winter type beer for me but i needed to try it fresh lesson learned from my ba ten fidy experience i only consumed half the bottle leaving some to enjoy tomorrowif i can hold out its a beast to be sure not an every day drink but a nice firstworld luxury for the per ounce price point utopias might be the more complex refined and charactered beverage but if i spend this much on beer again the missus might not be so forgiving ill call myself blessed and move on,0.5222404747668833,0.9864
3286,Bomb!,this is a strange one i love imperial stout especially big strong ones however i prefer them a bit drier i suppose this is much too cloyingly sweet for me the nose is mostly chili it looks decent like thick motor oil has legs no head to speak of though as i said taste is too sweet i dont get much other than booze and the chilis mouthfeel is super thick overall disappointed i paid so much for the bottle i usually go for even more jesus love that one way more or stone irs i have had so many of the style i enjoy a lot cant say this was one of them,0.5221201965016259,0.9734
4532,Impermanence,canned in a big old tallboy crafty can and brought back to me by my sister from a trip to berwick upon tweed pours a jet black body with massive thick tan head aroma is full on chocolate sryrup from a top coffee shop flavour is caramell mocha,0.522115459990114,0.2023
1702,Green,16oz can received as a gift from a friend purchased directly from the brewery canned on 9222020 with gimme the green stamped on the bottom so this is almost 3 months old  look pours a hazy golden orange color a nice soft onefinger head with decent retention the beer became much hazier when i swirled and poured the bottom of the can then it looked like unfiltered pineapple juice  smell interestingly enough the nose on this beer is quite green its almost hard to pick up other notes because the vegetal and green notes are so dominant up front there is a lot of stinky and rank oniony notes which are interesting yet personally not so desirable when present in such a dominant fashion very earthy as well those notes yield to some nice tropical flavors of papaya and orange on the finish which are a bit hard to pick out because the green notes are so strong as green as the beer seems to be the aroma has a lingering sweet and juicy finish theres also a lot of chalkiness in the nose and that is probably due to the age of the beer  taste this neipa is probably one of the more bitter ones that i have had and im not sure how i feel about it i like the juicy beers to have a bitter foil to them but i feel like this one goes beyond the use of kryptonite i also just have to wonder how much of the intended beer i am missing because i am not tasting it at its freshest up front there is a lot of tropical juicy sweetness  notes of orange juice unripe pineapple and papaya the midpalate of the beer was fine but unremarkable and that is probably what i am missing most from the lack of freshness here the finish is soft yet nicely pithy green and bittering to help balance out all the sweetness and juiciness lingers long and also leaves a remnant of salinity and juiciness on the palate that is quite pleasant i feel like i experienced two versions of the same beer in this can the first half that was mildly hazy lighter in body more balanced and more enjoyable and the second half that was super cloudy more pillowy bitter chalky and unbalanced  feel soft and pillowy appropriately carbonated  overall my second tree house beer i dont think that it has been done proper justice as these neipas generally dont age so well granted that it has been in my fridge for a while as it has been hard to find the right opportunity to enjoy it but in my defense i must note that this was given to me by a friend when it already had close to 2 months time on it all this being said i think that it is still evident that it is a wellmade beer it toally just needs to be enjoyed fresher i look forward to being able to rereview this one when i can enjoy a fresher offering as an aside it also puzzles me as to why some hoppy beers can do just fine with a bit of age yet other ones change so much and almost fall apart i would love to understand this more,0.5220707644810377,0.9975
2682,Black Tuesday - Reserve,ive only had this once liked it more than regular bt but still had the typical bruery sweetness and heat definitely more complex and interesting that regular though and overall a tasty beer thats perfect for a big share,0.5217958114163053,0.9703
2713,Notorious Triple IPA,this beer is pretty damn difficult to distinguish between it and pty seriously for years now ive been just skipping the big line at the dipa fest for pty and just getting notorious with no line the beers are almost indistinguishable  has a pretty color that is a mixture of both orange and gold comes with a 13 head  aroma is delightful all that hop noise under the nose usual descriptors of awesomeness pick whatever tropical stone and citrus fruits you want mix in those pinegreendank descriptors on top of it  taste wow hop bursting not overly aggressive ibu number mouth feel that hides all the alcohol super dry finish like damn this is light on its feet but so damn huge  there are so many 10 double and triple ipas these days pty no doubt was the innovator but there are some damn good substitute goods out there notorious ephraim waldo etc    it really makes waiting in line seem dumb when youre this far down the rabbit hole,0.5217662491187076,-0.5077
4471,Leaner,batch 2  101516  enjoyed at casey  just thinking about this beer makes my mouth water had it side by side with the cut peach and the look of the leaner is hazier and looks more like a peach color than the much more bright yellow and also delicious peach cut upon smelling it you get the sense its going to be intensely sour and it is but amazingly the peach flavor still shines through and it seems to be a perfect balance as the cut series is 5 abv i was shocked to realize after i had a few sips that the leaner was 8 the name is apropos it tastes like the most sour juicy peach youve ever had squeezed in a glass leaner is one of the best sours ive had psyched to have a couple bottles to save for a special occasion,0.5216687652419045,0.9743

3598,Darkness,bottled 91820 opened 123120 room temperature in tall rounded pilsner glass  look it is black totally black even around the edges no hind of color spilled on the light color counter just a couple drops by accident no hind of color  head retention was poor started out dense bubbles on top and small almost like a nitro on bottom quickly dissipated typical of warm beer  smell not strong you have to wait for it to fill the the glass very pleasant and complex  taste 1 when first hits the tongue it fills the mouth in a pleasant way before you even drink it in taste 2 pulled into mouth and swirled around nothing really changes still pleasant very little to none carbonation you do not really notice the alcohol with all the other strong flavors just the way an ris should be there is a weird tingling on the tongue the tingle is just odd and different taste 3 just swallowed this is the strongest flavor and most satisfying aftertaste the really hard one to master they got it perfect it lingers quit awhile morphs but stays quit pleasant never to sweet or to bitter  feel it is kind of thin but it does not distract from the beer with such a great aftertaste  problem the taste is so nice and it goes down so smooth i find myself drinking it much faster than i should especially for a 12  i am going to have to cellar some but do not see how it could improve much it is already as good a 2 plus year old stone ris  note from massachusetts but staying in minnesota for awhile,0.5215117541313429,0.9715
4313,Bad Boy,about a 3 week old bottle drank on 662017  ive been seeking this one out for a while and i can certainly see why this was in a league of its own when it was first released the piney dank citrus combo is really nice its incredibly drinkable and somehow theres very little bitterness while the abv is quite high i really enjoyed this one as this showcased the west coast style very nicely,0.5213773760738092,0.8623
3305,Pseudo Sue,must admit the main reason i paid 12 bucks for four of these was bc i am somewhat of an amateur scholar of paleontology and am fond of sue and the science this fossil has generated  much to my surprise i find it ranked 5th on pale ales wow lets have a taste then  certainly this is a tasty one its also a well deserved data point in the single hop citra club i myself brewed two batches of single hop citra beers one ipa and one cream ale both made my top six list additionally there were at least three single hop citra beers available when i bought this one  that being said i suspect that the craze over citra might have influenced the overall rating on this one  and now with all that out of the way  this beer is quite good damn tasty if i quantify it appropriately citra stands out but the overall character of a pale ale isnt lost although the line between pale ales and ipas isnt all that distinct in all cases  verdict go for it this is damn fine beer,0.5212977662702364,0.7992
3426,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,so excited to obtain one of these to sample lets give er a try hazy and deep golden with a fading white head certainly looks nice for the style honestly typical mosaic tropical nose is nice but nothing overwhelming here ok wonderful flavor here this is where this brew really rises above the rest of the hazy lot thats all over the place now tropical and dare i say just the right amount of sweet with the perfect blend of gentle bitterness on the end the feel on this beer is also top notch prickly creamy and just the right thickness ive rarely been blown away by a highly rated brew this one deserves it,0.5211989455571931,0.9651
588,Double Sunshine,lawsons sunshine is a staple here in new england and my goto ipa if im in the mood for something strong thats why i was surprised to see a double ipa version it ups the abv by about half a percentage point but takes some of that brighter happier notes and brings it down a few notes to be sweeter and a little stickier its strong but still well balanced and intense this is a good last beer of the night and only with a dd but the strength delivers some tasty hop notes without being burly or clumsy,0.5211941298731817,0.9797
1603,Nectarine Premiere,i had b2 last year and knew i had to get my hands on more b3 isnt quite as fruity or have the same mouthfeel but nevertheless its very similar best nose on any sour period many people comment how you can smell chocolate or coffee or other things and ive always thought that these were more resembling characteristics but this beer really does smell like straight nectarines and nothing else beautiful citrus the level of sour and acidity are damn near perfect ive had quite a few degarde beers and this is hands down my favorite right with imperial stone bu when i traded for the b2 with the peach i thought the peach was a total let down compared to this gem totally worth trying at least once,0.5211845147253833,0.9537
2294,Abricot Du Fermier,7 may 2020  beer 88  ba top 250 alert  corona day 56  acquired via trade  appearance 5  a glowing apricot orange beautiful white head still maintaining a strong presence after several minutes  nose 5  sour remember when classic saisons werent sour i recall that actually being a thing this one will be super sour apricot in there too  taste 5  ok so its not insanely sour but the apricot certainly comes to the fore and that barnyard funk theyre always talking about really shines on the back end  mouth 5  oh lordy im amazed at how thick this is like it takes a couple swallows to get it all down  overall 5  this is a real standout wow,0.5211652199099368,0.9764
4040,Double Nelson,pours a grainy golden theres a dank note that you may smell in some parts of the city where youths are skipping class to take part in other once questionable but not decriminalized in some states behavior it smells like week and there is definitely a note of it in flavor too theres a quiet peppery bitterness on the finish overall its wellmade just not even my favorite beer involving nelson from hill,0.5210731456781508,-0.1456
5023,Gueuze 100% Lambic,complex subtle sophisticated beautiful get the sour funky farmy smell upfront and at first sip but then more complexity comes through with in the palate a bit of the citrus flavours you get in a white wine beautifully balanced  wanted to try this one for a while got to have it as part of a zwanze day event here in australia  a 150ml pour from a keg shipped over from belgium would love to try a full bottle or two to appreciate it fully but even among some very other nice beers it stood out well worth a try if you can get your hands on it,0.5210635469557081,0.9819
585,Double Sunshine,bought a 4 pack fromt the brewery had to say this beer underwhelmed me a little bit based on the ratings its still a good beer but had a strange blend of sweet and bitter combo that just felt a little like a fight going on in the beer,0.5208773469848313,-0.0371
5557,Ghost In The Machine,this beer is overall a great start to a good night or a wonderful beginning to a barbeque the initial bite of the beer is not frightening and adds a nice bitterness to the pallet the beer is very aromatic giving you the wonderful floral smell of hops the overall look of the beer is very appealing giving off this smooth rich color of a thick wellbrewed ipa the flavor experience starts with the smell before even taking a sip giving off a crisp scent that as you drink will be surprised by the relatively smooth almost creamy texture of the drink for one that is more of a lightweight or for an overall nonheavy drinker this beer is a great choice allowing for a moderate buzz with less the overall taste is a powerhouse in your mouth the only downside and i mean the only is typically the price which tends to be higher than that of a more common selection it is definitely a party starter and great for special occasions if one can absorb the cost it would easily be the only beer you need in the cooler cheers,0.5206034218406979,0.9936
3727,Double Stack,nothing to say that hasnt already been said maple coffee batter just a touch thin noticed during my beer flight that gn loves a more bubbly approach to their beers all have been a touch thinner more effervescent than expected,0.5205287801223246,0.7096

2504,Bourbon Paradise,typical prairie stout appearance the flavor is delicious like one of the old 12oz bottles of bcbs coconut and vanilla are present but not overwhelming went back the next day for a second bottle after having this,0.5204432391830313,0.5346
987,Chemtrailmix,by far the best beer with cinnamon ive ever had very thick this was batch 1 that i had it was really well balanced cinnamon wasnt overpowering,0.5203519844864233,0.7645
4689,Ground State,this was a gifted bottle from a bif buddy  and one that i was very very excited about i shared this with friends at a local brewery thus my pour was small but the beer is undeniably impressive  the nose is full of maple and coffee notes the beer tastes of light coffee roast just a bit acidic from the coffee with plenty of pleasant maple syrup and cacao it is baffling to me that this is so much harder to get than fundamental observation  but as good as it is it perhaps should not surprise who wants to trade away such a fantastic beer,0.5203489420202326,0.9689
4540,Impermanence,canned 4920 consumed 52920  sweet milk stouts arent my favorite stouts to be honest ill take a bitter expedition or darkness any day but this one has enough balance that i was able to drink 16oz without being overwhelmed its a great beer for the style more maple forward than anything but not too much like the surly 13 anniversary i had recently that was really disappointing super thick and full bodied worth buying again but wish they did it in 10oz cans,0.5202725876533745,0.869
3521,Mocha Wednesday,thanks to chris the local guy for this 750ml bottle sampled this previously but never sat down with a full pour  very happy to do so split with my wife  the pour is surprisingly light a muddly brown rather than abyssian darkness head vanishes quickly to nothing the nose is just as advertised chocolate roast booze barrel meets expectations like rearended ford pinto  mocha wednesday is boozier than waking up inside a bourbon barrel now i know how the dwarves felt on the forest river well kind of massive hit of alcohol  bourbon in yo face  my feet feel suddenly further away large scale sweetness from the malts chocolate roast thats quieter than the nose would suggest underneath the chaos is molasses  something else i could identify if i wasnt already drunk thick decadent  would pair well with my wifes lovely baileys cheesecake mmmmm love this could have taken it solo  pastry stout has been used as a recent epitaph but in my mouth its a viral compliment hand me a glass of this anytime an elite beer that improves marginally on the near perfection that is black tuesday please help me up the stairs if you see me napping somewhere other than my bed later thanks in advance,0.5202695429575535,0.9959

2827,Double Shot,picked up 2 cases of treehouse 2 weeks ago got 4 of these drank one before trekkies wedding last week this review is based on that beer  crack can looks black inside pours black outside brown head 35 deep looks impressive found the aroma to be weaker than expected in terms of the coffee presence was pretty mild for something rated world class and a double shot of a name rated the 1 stout in the world although its 82 abv should prolly have it categorized as a double stout but then it wouldnt be 1 if they did that  taste was fine delivered on every commercial tug job aspect the beer talks about yes there is lots of hearty roasted malt plenty of chocolate malt notes even plenty of coffee notes from the roasted malt but the coffee presence itself i dunno ive literally had dozens of better coffee beers much less coffee stouts some dude said these were 8 a can but i dont recall seeing that when i got mine mouthfeel was good alcohol wasnt problematic i liked it and will look forward to cracking the other 3 cans of it i dunno sometimes my nose isnt working good but i wasnt tasting it either perhaps i will revise the aroma upward if that is the case,0.519949517144512,0.9253

4105,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,i have to differ from the crowd on this review i found this to have a soso taste nondescript smell and a somewhat disagreeable pine aftertaste maybe it was a bad batch got it on april 25 2020 from the canton brewery,0.5197449290327587,-0.7102
1216,Framboise Du Fermier,easily the best ive ever had from side project its fantastic and the raspberries shine through perfectly it also strikes a great balance between its tartness and its drinkability,0.5197322533358936,0.9517
459,Julius,for me it does not stand above other neipas and ct style ipas in the manner i see so often described its very good beer but i dont think its the best treehouse beer that ive tried definitely gives off orange tangerine even warping into mango its certainly luscious bodied and big but it did not blow me away but when youre expecting the best beer in the world its not really fair to the beer or your expectations excellent beer,0.5196418372515583,0.9767
4084,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,my first trillium in quite awhile so i am really excited for it its hazy and looks like any other hazy ipa some others are brighter and more instagramable i suppose though as with the best ipas im loving the balance here between sweetness and malt it has a nice dry finish with bitter tart fruit its not overly juicy but im assuming thats not the goal here either a great beer i wish i could share it if i werent under a sheltering decree by our governor,0.5196405772825794,0.9703

963,Ann,nice subtle honey without being overly sweet and very smooth to drink of course its delicious but it wasnt quite the world breaker i was expecting definitely dont pass on it but there are imo much better beers to trade half your cellar away for,0.5195554884059158,0.8723
4953,Affogato,wonderful coffee notes to the nose and taste i was a bit surprised that this is not richer  the mouthful was slightly thin compared to monsters park we shared shortly afterwards,0.5194678249926533,0.6398
4900,Aurelian Lure,its amazing to me how much more attention these fruited beers get this is a fine liquid but some of their standard stuff has so much more to offer on flavor aroma complexity and mouthfeel  this is very champagnelike and while i dont have a lot of experience reviewing champagnes it has a dry bubbly effervescence with some sweet tang in there as well  all the flavors marry to the point that it becomes one golden royal potion where nothing really stands out and says apricot but its there in peach pear apple and even white grape expressions the sourness is mildly oaky tingly and faintly sharp on the swallowits so well developed that it really could be put up against some of the best france has to offer but what would i know in that regard i rate beers  my first review was for the 2015 vintage ive had multiples since then but this final review is an amalgamation of all of them capped off by a blend 4 enjoyed in may 2019,0.5194423164775626,0.9778
4290,DFPF,what have you seen what this stuff looks like bright fuchsia liquid glowing in my glass absolutely astonishing to look at nose is all passion fruitsmells amazing taste is also all passion fruit with some perfect tartness to finish feel is excellent and dry overall this is an amazing berliner and hands down the most insane looking beer ive ever seen,0.5193488538217095,0.9733
4740,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,2018 vintage consumed july of 2020   despite living in florida i had never really dipped into much of funky buddhas product beyond a couple of their standard year round offerings  the reviews for this beer are quite high which is why i was so tremendously disappointed with it  poured about 6 ounces into a glass had about a quarter inch head clearly light bodied aromas were not terrible mostly with maple  taste was mostly maple with some bacon and coffee notes of course feels rather carbonated  i honestly felt more like i was drinking a watery maple bacon soda than i was drinking a beer my girlfriend loved it though so i guess ill buy it for her going forward  overall its a mediocre beer at best certainly not worth the tremendous praise it receives this seems to be a trend for me and their dark beer though as i feel the same about two other highly rated offerings i tried on the same day  was looking for a nice robust porter with notes of maple bacon and coffee what i got was a watery mess that i wont drink again,0.5193100093608861,0.9603
4221,La Fosse,this beer definitely has apricot in it the smell is there and the taste is there along with some punch you in the face sourness this beer is very acidic and funky and plays well with the fruit did a side by side with map of the sun and de gardes imperial apricot and this came in 2nd to dg map came in a distant 3rd,0.5192107372005927,0.6293

1117,Atrial Rubicite,ive been chasing down a bottle of atrial for a few months now  i missed it at the festival of wood and barrel aged beers fobab in november of 2017 kicked in the vip session and ive had a couple of trades fall through and then suddenly i had two trades go through within a week of each other exciting  i shared my first bottle blend seven with friends recently atrial smells tremendous  i love the sweet tart rich raspberry nose the beer itself is quite a lot dryer than i had expected and tremendously tart it doesnt punch you in the jaw with sour but there is a pleasant sourness to it there is definitely a barrel presence in that dryness i was surprised by how dry it was given that sweet juicy almost cloying nose to it  while the bottle hunt was frustrating i think it was ultimately worth it and id happily do it again i need to try more of jester kings fruited sours  their saisons are excellent and easily purchased but the sours are what really interest me,0.5191915671423024,0.9922

2486,Sunday Brunch,the first whiff and sip of this beer is incredible cinnamon stands out most prominent over the nice coffee in the background its like a warm cinnabun the only problem with this beer is its quite sweet and it starts to take its toll if you have a whole glass nb,0.5189479948465201,0.855
2519,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,quite a good bourbon barrel aged beer if anything i guess it could use a touch more barrel character but it really did round out the aggressive hops and roast that the base beer has plus i think people are also forgetting how affordable this beer is i picked up a couple cans for under 4 each and that is quite a steal for such a treatment sure it may not be 100 out of 100 but it is still a very smooth easy drinking bba stout,0.518900302630157,0.5774
294,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),nothing would compare to the first ever cbs i had but the newest year have a respectable felt and flavor the maple and chocolate pair for a fair combination of 2 of the most seek flavors in a ba stout body its not as thick as i personally like but the flavor is there overall a good beer,0.5186909039893922,0.9428

3867,Montmorency Vs Balaton,becoming somewhat more accessible i had this at brick store pub atl on draft for zwanze day 2019 and in a bottle at porter beer bar amazing balance of sweet sour and funk from a knock punch of cherries to the palate would have a third time if i see it up north,0.5184879351334397,0.7783

4465,Leaner,they have brewed this beer every year for the last 3 years straight and its considered retired  when was the last time oude fermier or ann was freshly brewed those are still on the top 250 list just food for thought  leaner b2 pours a beautiful orange glow the dregs at the end of the of the bottle were added to everyones glass and added a hazy dreamsicle look aroma is a spritzer peach lacking the oak theory funk this is cleaner and pronounces the fruit well taste is fuzzy peaches a bit puckering at first but mellows quickly all fruit all sour all good feel is bit on the sourside like mentioned above i dont remember a casey bottle with that type of feel must be the side project cultures taking over a bit overall an extremely good sour sour peaches to the max happy to finally get to try this one would seek it out again,0.5181405010638056,0.9707
118,Heady Topper,purchased as a 4 pk from a chilled case consumed about 1 month after brew date nice gold color with moderate hazeno floaties beautiful white voluminous head that lasts a awhile and leaves some nice lacing smell was more muted than i expected given the advertised emphasis on the hops but the flavor was very nice and complex with no single flavor dominating this is like a whole bunch of ingredients mashed up together but in a good way so that nothing slaps you in the face as a single ingredient carrying most of the load yes i did drink some from the can but no big difference from the flavor in the glass and this one looks so nice it is a shame not to take in the visual pleasure overall really nice but the cost 184pk is offputting since other darned good ipas can be had for significantly less,0.5180355449133935,0.9808
397,Assassin,dark black pour lacing for days  cherry and birch bark on the nose smells more like a quad  the awesome texture on the front of the tongue is quickly assaulted by liquorice anaise and anything else you might taste after opening up a package of black twizlers candy it coats the mouth throat lungs belly all the way down to my big toe each additional sip seems to enhance the assault were it not for the heavy price id paid for this bottle i would not want to finish it this drinks hottermore painful than most 1820 stouts but as a glutton for punishment im very disappointed in this one,0.5180064137295061,-0.9023

237,SR-71,what is funny about my sr71 experience is  while i missed the release of 2018 i was able to enjoy the og bottle the very same day  while coolcold sr71 is tasting a bit oxidized the barrels and quite a bit of chocolate are still present but the beer tastes a bit dull and stale as the beer warms the chocolate turns to fudge and that oxidization fades quickly sr71 is extremely barrel forward yet still exhibits loads of chocolate and fudge in the nose and taste its a delicious beer and i rate it highly  i think my one experience with it will have to suffice given secondary values im fairly sure that ill never see it again  and thats okay this one experience has been quite memorable enough,0.5174573992874816,0.8641
2240,Triple Shot,this stuff is divine and in such an unassuming package too crazy thanks to my brother for sourcing this rarity thought i might never get to taste this one its a treat too so much coffee enough so even that is stands out as way more than the vanilla bean double shit which we enjoyed right before this one its almost gritty and bitter in comparison but the vanilla sure did a lot to sweeten that up and round it out here we have a truer expression of the coffee more isolated in a way and i love how robust it is almost as much coffee as it is beer although i do get a little booziness poking through this one in the aroma the coffee has deep chocolate tones to it a little spiciness even a rigid sort of bitterness mid palate and a real richness as well notes of molasses and maple work in from the grain here and there is a neat almost amaretto layer maybe not quite as complex as the double shot was to me a little more straight forward from the grain but i love the way the coffee manifests itself in here about as forward as i have known it to be in any beer and lingering forever on the palate after each slow sip this is the ultimate coffee beer really and the freshness of the coffee really stands out as well especially for something that was bottle many months before we opened it it was wonderful to finally get to drink some of these hard to get tree house stouts thanks to my brother these were unforgettable,0.5174199017925799,0.9903
2447,Black Gold,pours a deep black with more than head than expected thicker than i remember last year lots of nice barrel on both nose and taste very smooth and no heat love this one and will seek it out every year,0.5174186929883395,-0.4645
532,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,2020 vintage  jet black low head retention but a stubborn ring of lacing huge coconut and chocolate on the nose the taste is really unbelievable as far as staying true to the title ive been told by several this is the best vintage yet and i can understand why pastry stouts are already somewhat gimmicky by nature but this one delivers the adjuncts in a way that is somehow both aggressive and balanced it finishes thick smooth and lingers for a while this is a real treat and delivers on the hype in a way that i rarely see drink fresh,0.5173983671478399,0.9041
5478,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,vintage 2020518 this officially serves to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that not everything from 2020 was a dumpster fire appearance is amazing maybe because i was so ready for a beer but few beers have looked better black with dark brown highlights and a thin brown head the aroma was malts and plums and raisins and more malts the taste i literally said wow  i was so ready for this just so smooth without sharp edges typically found in riss maybe the bourbon maybe the aging cant say but wow the feel obviously imo but it struck me as ideal for the genre viscous but not too much and i mentioned smoothness earlier oh yes so glad they are in michigan thanks larry for this,0.5173563490257292,0.9815
6178,The Streets,its remarkable that this doesnt come off as boozy at all given its high abv lots of flavor but a little too brightbitter compared to some other trilliums nothing wrong with it just some i like better,0.5172157269737198,0.9141
5189,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,this seems like a natural extension of the original ten fidy it totally can handle the extra attention and it deserves it  the thing has about as brown a head as you will see the smell is nice and boozy  alcohol and whisky the taste goes where you expect to the malty roast hoppy bourbon booze place it works you can tell its huge  nothing is hidden no need to drink any whisky if you have a couple of these be careful  recommended it is pretty pricey but a nice treat for a deserving drinker,0.5171701465529543,0.945
2756,Mexican Brunch,2017 vintage wow this one is off the charts delicious the head is modest but it is a beautiful deep dark brown with a small amount of khaki head that fades into a light ring around glass and patches of foam on the surface i find the coffee and cinnamon are most prevalent on the nose but you get a hint of the chocolate the flavor is just remarkable coffee cinnamon chiles come through first the maple and cacao are on the finish which is just smooth and delightful kane knocked this one out of the park,0.5171074721901542,0.969
814,Blessed,this is suuuuuper sweet coconuts with some to spare thicc doesnt begin to describe this on the level of coconut vibes crazy and excellent and too much for diabetics,0.5170271261567164,0.6486
1335,Cable Car,2016 vintage had on draft at lost abbey 10th anniversary party may 21 2016 writing review on notes i took that day l golden color eversoslightly cloudy big white foamy head s somewhat muted at first since i was drinking this outside but as it warmed and i went inside the aroma really shined through lemon peach apricot pear funk minor white grape the funkiness was singular and one i had never smelled before very enjoyable aroma t taste was great also lemon and stone fruits were the headliners here along with that uncommon and nice funkiness f mouthburst was subtle and not sharp at the end so it was nicedrinking throughout o it was difficult to finally grab this especially without having to pay the toronado prices but it was well worth the effort one of my all time favorite sours easily very high class,0.5169520065774468,0.9814
633,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),2015 vintage im not a lover of the dark fruits character that tends to result in aged dark beers but thats what i got suffice to say the taste was the most mellow that ive ever experienced like a fine wine it did keep some of its belgian quad character and it was outstanding,0.5169380669321313,0.8724
8,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,this dark nectar poured like a heavenly scented motor oil into my glass its like someone took my morning coffee maple syrup and best bourbon and combined them into this once in a lifetime treat i could still smell the maple syrup days later from the empty bottle sitting on my desk,0.516800542658215,0.9337
641,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),been a while since i wrote a review but this is worth the time worth the hype especially if you love quads smell is amazing plum dark fruits and sweetness flavor follows the nose whats most surprising about this beautiful beer is that its not heavy as youd expect from a quad and its the perfect amount of sweet truly one of the best beers ive ever had,0.5167634565006242,0.9944
3860,Montmorency Vs Balaton,bottled feb 2019 consumed 5921  so excited to try this the be had an atrial before and it ranked up there as one of my favorite wild ales ever upon pouring it it looks beautiful love the color im super disappointed on the nose though i get a bit of funk and cherrry but its very muted on the palette though its more pronounced it has a wonderful balance of cherry but could use more bret funk for my preference i probably like the funk more than most people though theres a wonderful balance of sweet and tart with the cherries too a lovely beer overall probably not my top 23 but worth the word class ratings,0.5167494149533758,0.9867
3612,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,january 1st 2016  also kicking off 2016 is a beer from almost a decade ago the 2007 cantillon lou pepe our assumption is that this is perhaps a little long in the tooth even for a mythically legendary beer like this but i have high hopes and great trust in the belgian craftsmen who have honed this recipe through generations and it seems that my trust was well allocated because the smell is absolutely beautiful chocolate cream and with a slight fruity sweetness even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength but the taste is spicier and while it borrows some of the chocolate from the nose it expresses more like a mole with that kick absolutely fascinating and delicious this has aged quite wonderfully,0.5167136471709834,0.9967
490,Very Green,thanks to rub_this_bbq for this one from a recent ninja box 16oz can dated 31121 poured into 14oz teku poured a muddy orange color with an inch of white head that had good retention and lacing  as expected frooty hops dominate the nose orange being dominant no grainmalt presence  starts out pretty similar on the tongue lots of froot loops but in the middle and back there was a certain amount of bitterness that saved the beer  the body was the typical mediumthin of the style smooth and had a finish that while still on the sweet side was much drier than anticipated  drinkability was fine probably great if youre a fan of the style  overall a nice brew but i dont see where it stands out from its peers worth trying if you get the chance,0.5164326217599803,0.9803
2203,Galaxy Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,theres just something about trillium beers and this one is not exception they call it a pale and thats definitely up for debate but whats not up for debate is the notation that this is a world class brew because it is the galaxy dry hop on this beer gives it an extra does of that new zealand spiciness while at the same time delivering distinct tropical notes and trilliums yeast strain helps to add a dry snappy finish its an amazing beer worthy of your seeking,0.5163746712526583,0.9325
3088,Parabajava,big hipbump to ficklenicholas for this bottle which arrived recently with 11 friends in the best bif box ive received in a long  distinguished career a long time want 22 oz 2016 bottle split with my wife  the pour is parabola black  the coffee beans do not seem to have lightened the brew into a blond barleywine or anything my wife reports she can smell the coffee from several feet away the rest of the smell is wild  i hope foreshadows how my tongue will be feeling shortly huge coffee chocolate vanilla with the barrel a late light entry  i cant imagine how coffeeforward parabajava must have been 18 months ago even now its a java blast to the mouthskin but its of the smoother variety less roast smoothness integrated tightly into the bourbon barrel sanding all the rough edges off of both bourbon is a long slow burn midpalate vanilla slightly scorched wood soft chocolate  oh theres the roast not much but right on the finish moderate body  zero alcohol both of which seem less than likely drinkable wow im sucking this like its coming off of nice teat  excellent beer but next time i order ill ask the house to hold the coffee  just bring me my parabola black still not complaining,0.5162473537834265,0.9738

3159,Pseudo Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,people are raving about this one apparently but id counter a bit as id put this third behind regular pseudo sue and the galaxy version which is my favorite due to a strong affinity for galaxy hops this is very clean and crisp but more aggressively bitter than the others and some flavor nuance is lost for me still obviously very well made and love getting cans less than two weeks old,0.5161530010209808,0.9165
1979,Doppelganger,as tree house indicates doppelgänger is an imperial version of alter ego  which i think of is a cousin to their flagship beer julius so you could think of doppelgänger as a second cousin to julius darker and a little danker than some of their other ipas great smell the mouthfeel is what really won me over heavier than jukius in a good way great beer,0.5161175637219093,0.9476
4133,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,season 1617 blend no 51  drank november 2nd 2019 while cleaning out a few bottles of lambic what truly stands out to me about this blend is that its quite absent the typical apples that define many geuzes  the tart and sour notes are far more present and the beer doesnt have quite the same body lots of oak notes dominate as well its funky but only lightly so  quite a terrific beer im not sure that id rate it significantly superior to drie fonteinens standard oude geuze though that being said i absolutely adore the standard geuze it amazes me that its a shelfie in certain parts of the country,0.5160327201191393,0.972
4376,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,i cansider myself very fortunate to have been the lucky winner of a buncha cans in a recent lottery on a different social media site i merely had to pony up the cost of shipping which was modest in return for a buncha cans for the canquest tm i had heard of  was certainly aware of trillium bc but i have not been trading in a while  so i did not give them much thought i am now interested in drinking  reviewing the entire small bird series especially pipsqueak penguin  stumpy duck since i have an affinity for the former  a rubber form of the latter who oversees my drinking  will be in an nbs pic later  nowt to report from the stark grey  white can 8  my last of the day for nbs week 659 began with a crack followed by a gentle glug revealing yet another deeply cloudy unfiltered beer hmm a vigorous inglass swirl raised a brief finger of soapy foamy tawny head with limited retention quickly reducing to wisps color was a milky murky cloudy yellowgold srm 4  5 nose smelled of both tangerine sweet orange and honey but it also had a bready yeastiness like rising dough that might have been avoided with some filtration mouthfeel was medium but light for the style the taste was kind of an oddball admixture of flavors ranging from earthy freshlyturned soil to sweet clover honey to rising bread dough to tangerinesweet orange to a light alcohol heat that tingled my sinus cavity phew it was certainly attentiongetting but it also had a graininess that left my mouth feel like it was coated in powder after each swallow i cannot help but wonder what even a modicum of filtration might have done for this beer finish was dry but not overly bitter more citrusy than anything else i was glad to have tried it but i was not as big a fan as others seem to have been based on the overall score,0.5158934917473627,0.9856
3061,Cable Car Kriek,bottles at the dc lambic  sour tasting on april 14 2012 served in a lost abbey teku  big thanks to brad for acquiring two different versions of this rarity the first was an unlabeled version that was allegedly dubbed too sour and not released the second was the labeled version available at toronado the review that follows is of the regular version from toronado after that are some notes on the unlabeled version in comparison to that one  gusher alert holy hell did this thing explode even after being stored cold and opened right out of the fridge as soon as the cage came off the cork started pushing up and beer shot out sideways several feet thankfully we were mostly prepared as had we not been ready i think we would have lost the whole bottle  after all that the beer pours a hazy and murky reddishamber with a small offwhite head that recedes pretty quickly leaving just a bit of sparse lacing behind  the nose carries heavy notes of cherry with a bit of nutty pit in there though just a touch behind that is a really nice bit of earth and some very light barnyard the flavor was similar and brought plenty of cherry along with some light funk and moderate acidity  body was medium with average carbonation and a dry finish really a lot more depth to this one than with the 2010 cable car that we had alongside the two kriek versions  compared to the regular version the too sour unlabeled version did not have nearly as much cherry and had quite a bit more acidity the cherry that was there seemed to be more of a sour cherry and there werent nearly as many earthy notes this reminded me much more of the cable car with cherries added whereas the labeled version seemed like a different beer very interesting comparison thanks again brad,0.5157554712008979,0.9089
3656,Heavy Mettle,just an enormously hopped beer that blows beyond what my finicky palate can handle these days carry on and pick up the info you seek from a more hopheaded review  about as archetypical in look and taste and feel for a 9 ne style dipa that without the darling new hops in the mix mosaic citra galaxy etc just an enormous specimen that will hoppunch your pie hole out the back of your head,0.5157446477685318,-0.4717

4872,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,shared with friends at cbc como on 12718 2017 versionblue label pours about as black as it gets with no real head to speak of great nose with hints of cinnamon and spice predominant and a hint of barrel from there i guess i was a bit let down having the regular version on a few occasions i was expecting the barrel treatment to give this beer a boost instead the flavors come off a little muddled yes i got some cinnamon cocoa and chiliesmost unaffected but they were struggling to the forefront with the presence of the barrel itself,0.5156450853218361,0.3738
2241,The Broken Truck,bottle courtesy of chardlogic 121 bottling 7 batch i believe label states blended from the last four years really great blend tastes like an authentic aged gueuze from one of the belgian masters,0.5153740161506786,0.8553
4192,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,had on site at hf 8182017  decadent and smooth with just a hint of barrel wish there was a little more extremely rich mouthfeel so glad i was finally able to try this one definitely worth seeking out,0.5152572053972779,0.926
5925,Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,definition of 1 dimensional  a reasonably sour golden ale with oak notes overall quite nice but nothing to write home about would buy again though probably only 1 bottle  as a side everyone else kept saying how balanced it was however i get none of that to me it was just a very tart saison or a light american wild,0.5151779222514329,0.2609
4764,Last Snow,very tasty while the northern states enjoy their stouts and porters this of time we floridians need a tropical touch coconuts was exactly what was needed excellent porter to enjoy through the holidays,0.5151179440339035,0.9136
1258,Anabasis,there are two things that most craft beer nerds get wrong about anabasis  1 the pronunciation of its name 2 the perceived goat status of this beer in the realm of barleywines  it took nearly four years to track down a pour of this legendary beer but only a fraction of that time to realize that i along with the majority of the craft beer world had been deceived by the hypelords of the american midwest  anabasis is a largely onenote barleywine that delivers on mild licorice flavors with a prominent bourbon barrel character on the front of the palate and little else it misses the mark on what a truly great barleywine should deliver in terms of taste there is no depth of flavor or complexity to this beer on the palate falling far short of the flowery tasting notes description that c king offers on the label of the bottle  perhaps the saving grace of this beer is that it is remarkably thick relative to other barrel aged offerings in this style to this end anabasis resembles more of a stout than a barleywine which sits well with the mouthfeel chasers of the hobby  if you are a true fan of the barleywine style anabasis is sure to disappoint given the incredible amounts of hype surrounding the beer and the overall underwhelming flavor profile it presents if however your flavor preferences lean more towards simple stouts this may be the beer for you the mouthfeel and barrel character that envelops the base beer is world class and worth visiting if the cost of entry is low  the letdown of this beer reminded me of my first hill farmstead ann experience a combination of low bottle counts high trade values exorbitant secondary values and craft beer fomo led to an artificially inflated expectation of the beer one which ultimately detracted from the overall enjoyment of the drink in my glass  there are many other barleywines that can be acquired and consumed with far less effort than it takes to land a bottle of anabasis that likely will yield a more enjoyable tasting experience i assure you the rarity of this bottle and its secondary value do not contribute in any way to a more enhanced flavor or a greater overall enjoyment of this beer,0.5150874487048375,0.9929
1026,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting shes upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night which is 22 oz so this experience begins with stress and tension and a couple eye rolls i purchased this from a private seller for 40 which is probably way too much to pay but i cant get this around here in ohio and id heard so much about this beer i had to try it so every whale has its price i suppose glad to be trying a beer from tampa as ive been watching some interviews toady with shock g aka humpty hump about the history of hip hop and hes from tampa poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head a shade darker than khaki it quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass to be honest this smells like wet metal iron blood and a little chocolate dark berry and thick dark sugary things like molasses im actually getting a lot of plum from this taste plum and raisin and dates more plum than plum tuckered out by hoppin frog very sweet heavy and dark a little burned tasting slight cinnamon bittersweet chocolate a bit of vanilla on the back end although the description says theres some scoville units on this one i cant detect any spiciness whatsoever mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence overall it is very good but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be this is rated 100 on this website and i think it tastes really good but im not going to be that generous as i dont think theres anything particularly unique about the brew maybe im just sullied by my wifes remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact im drinking this whole thing tonight so much for 40 maybe better luck next time,0.5150313163637414,0.9887
5153,Clare's Thirsty Ale,haymarket is the type of place that i assume existed more commonly before the craft beer boom a place that makes awesome beer but somehow manages to stay under the radar possibly due to how close it is to au cheval and every other trendy restaurant in the area  seeing this beer on tap necessitated a trip to haymarket since its rare to get a chance to try the stuff pours a beautiful dark brown with just a hint of red from the raspberries think of a beer mixed with wine the nose is similarly fudgy with berries  really the only bad thing i have to say about this beer is that i wish it were a thicker beer the taste itself is delicious with lots of raspberry flavor for a beer this big and the barrel treatment serves only to round it all out honestly im not sure a thicker mouthfeel would help because a large part of the appeal is just how much raspberry you get on the front end which may be lost if the beer were thicker  im not sure this is the best ba stout with fruit as an adjunct but i think it may do the best at actually portraying a berry flavor this is like a chocolate stout mixed with jam awesome and right behind the absolutely glorious 22 month ba indignant my favorite haymarket beer,0.5147409536215958,0.9938
3124,Framboos,priciest beer ive bought to date  50 in belgium sat on this for about a year awaiting the right occasion and my friends bachelor party seemed like a great time to bring it out simply put this is a wonderful lambic that is overflowing with raspberry character the clean funkytartness of the base lambic complements the intense raspberry nicely and the drinkability is topnotch as per usual with 3 fonteinen reminded me a lot of allagashs coolship red which is a more reasonably priced and relatively easily available alternative  90100 cr,0.5145473260418811,0.9732
5082,Barrel Aged Bomb!,bottled 2016 i think its hard to read consumed 41220  ive been waiting to have this guy for awhile as bomb is one of my first strong stouts that ive ever loved some other prairie stouts can have too many adjuncts for me to really love but im hoping ba bomb hits the ride balance first thing i notice is that it seems thinner than other prairie stouts im used to theres very little carbonation too even for a stout i wonder if the age has something to do with that some lacing does stay though after the pour on the nose i am not getting a lot of barrel but some spice like a regular bomb i taste a bit of the pepper but not a lot i think thats usually what goes after aging its sweet but not overly so theres barrel flavor too chocolate and vanilla notes a prominent the beer is great but i wish i had it fresh i think the aging has muted some of the best components of the beer the barrel is perfect though great beer and worth seeking out,0.5145425424744451,0.9925
4625,Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,bottling date  september 27th 2018  pours a hazy beautiful golden funk lemon zest hay on the nose maybe some unripe peach as well its lightly tart with a mineral note on the finish theres some stone fruit character as well the minerality is kind of copper penny like which ive experienced in other beers that feature the drie yeast culture the mineralitys prominence is not something ive experienced in other bottles i started this review ready to declare this one of the best slept on for drie lambics out there based on previous bottles ive had i am not going to do that at this moment ill update this if i open other bottles that reflect the greatness ive previously uncorked,0.5144903052344028,0.926
4918,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,2019 vintage have had most of lift bridges offering and found them to be good but not exceptional silhouette is the latter pours pitch black with some light barely visible at the top edge in my spiegelau stout glass delicious meld of coffee and bourbon on the nose flavor profile goes together perfectly not too much bourbon but the perfect amount imho and not too boozy but just right nice full body but not too much either this is fantastic and given the choice of this or some of the better know ba stouts like bcbs cbs or kbs ive enjoyed id pick this over them,0.5144460408963106,0.9924

5606,Space Trace,2018 bottle poured into large snifter  this has been a long time want for me and it was a big letdown it was kind of a bitter mess so dry it was almost as if it were aged in cab franc barrels instead of bourbon barely any raw coconut with minimal sweetness i seem to be the odd one out here maybe it was a bad bottle because i know the height of quality these guys usually reach with their barrel aged beers,0.5142892834294928,-0.7579
319,Fundamental Observation,its a vanilla bomb tasty its almost too much vanilla for me but its a treat good for bottle shares theres no way i could tackle one by myself,0.5142792235092595,0.743
4354,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Daydream, 102018 on tap at oh   102318 can to wine glass  biggest difference from dream to daydream is less citrus more grassy  results in less nose and a bit of offputting flavors in the finish still excellentjust takes a backseat to the real dream  ,0.5142476843726468,0.4588
541,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,ive nearly managed to try barrel aged imperial german chocolate cupcake stout on two or three occasions now  this time it did not elude me i also had the pleasure of trying this side by side with the nonbarrelaged bottle  and while this experience certainly hurt my teeth a bit it was a pretty great time to be alive  ive had my fair share of sweet sticky dessert beverages but theres just something about angry chairs dessert stouts that surpasses everyone elses attempts  the beers are practically simple syrup in consistency and taste but then theyre also quite high in abv and dont taste it for a second baigccs is like a bucket of fudgy chocolate cake batter goodness  it coats your glass and its absolutely opaque the carb is so minimal that its like drinking a light viscosity glass of motor oil a delicious one obviously the nose is rich and warm and that chocolate is just excellent on the nose and in the taste buds  i really liked this beer  but as i told my friends i think this will be the only time ill ever drink it and im honestly pretty okay with that its just too much  theres no moderation to this beer its a bottle that you essentially need to share because the flavors and syrupyness of the beer is just unrelenting  in all like many of angry chairs beers its a tremendously compelling novelty  i really enjoy and would certainly recommend it but i can happily live without it ever again yum and done basically,0.5142415529873592,0.9969

6004,Black Tuesday - Rum Barrel-Aged,2020 208 abv  disappointed with this release crazy legs and some notable heat on this one which is to be expected from a bt variant especially at this abv however it lacks all the nuance i expect from a bt i can definitely taste the base beer but not much else even the base beer is not as prominent because it shares the stage with the taste of booze i think i detect a trace of rum and barrel but it is so insignificant that i could easily just be convincing myself of something that really aint there compared to other bt variants this aint it compared to other big rum barrel aged stouts this definitely aint it this was my first experience with bt rum barrel aged and rum barrels just so happen to be my favorite medium to age stouts from the looks of other reviews this should have been a tasty damn beer maybe next year,0.5139109542227137,0.7629
845,Lou Pepe - Kriek,gorgeous to look at and almost just as good to drink i found the cherries to be even a little bit sweet to help combat the sour tartness which i loved still cant decide if i like this or the lp framboise better,0.5137387420076046,0.9581

4367,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,this beer is a beautiful expression of galaxy which ill admit im a galaxy fanboy this is so tasty and the honey only smoothing out the edges of the pine and sweet resin from the galaxy makes it even better perfect execution the only tweak i would make to make it my number 1 beer ever beats is infinite by monkish a ddh all galaxy imperial ipa would be to double dry hop this beer with more galaxy to bring out that grapefruit and grassy taste to the next level phenomenal best trilltive ever and its not close,0.5136165841291,0.9517

2605,Alter Ego,tasted in a spiegelau ipa glass from a one pint can on december 24 2019 alter ego is a member of the julius family taking the base of julius and adding a tremendous amount of mosaic to the dry hop with a kiss of amarillo what results is a beer with all the deliciousness of julius with a pungent additional layer of citrusy complexity,0.5132700978052794,0.6808
597,Double Sunshine,excellent dipa i was lucky enough to drink it at the source and also bring home a 4pk finished the last cans at 3 months old and they were still singing clean clear bright aromas and flavors great beer phenomenal brewery,0.5132479257683675,0.9571
1987,Doppelganger,another really nice offering from tree house compared with its relatives i enjoyed this more than alter ego but less than aaalterrr ego sorry if i missed a few letters in there or alter ego w peach a nice balanced nedipa thats got a good amount of hop bite and plenty of juicy character to balance it out its easy to get blasé about tree houses ipastyle beers because theyre so darn good  this really is an excellent beer but there are also 10 or 12 th beers in the same style that i prefer,0.5130757816217376,0.9721
1312,Headroom,2018 batch  canned 810  823 i could understand the hype but it was way too dank for me it popped up in the mid palate and wiped everything else out except for the greenness otherwise it was excellent on the initial attack with soft tropical fruits  920 i am now part of the hype the dankness and greenness have mellowed out to allow more of the tropical fruits to pop up dankness is still heavy but comes through prominently in the finish with a medium bitterness a months time has done this wonders and i like it significantly more than i did when fresh,0.5130752502917536,0.7096
1612,Nectarine Premiere,really gorgeous beer here  and the oak wine barrels give it a nice complexity i really wasnt even sure what a nectarine was but i definitely know now,0.5130735499740461,0.7568
4227,La Fosse,imcredible beer only had a small 3 oz sample at the fwibf into a 6 oz snifter the stone fruit shines and is comimented nicely with the puckering sour of the lactic acid for a side project these brews continue to take on starring roles,0.5130618088997395,0.4404
5156,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,really hard to beat quintessential ipa that merges the classic bitter west coast style with the softness of neipas  this review is based on a can purchased from the brewery 8 days ago with a stamp from 10 days ago  look the looks are probably the least enchanting but still stellar mild haze but not too thick based on this alone id assume tasty but not this tasty walnut wood with a bit of glow really nice lacing on the glass but head disappears rather quickly  smell grapefruit juice maybe a bit of tangerine fuck does this shit smell dank and delish  taste more grapefruit but a pine needle slipped into the juicer and contaminated the grapefruit juice in the best possible way  feel medium carb but smooth like honey not smooth like the overfluffed beers that are dominating the east coast right now just right  overall easily the best beer ive had in the last year maybe more the double fuzzy is great when youre in the market for a tad bit more gravity and have a bit more time to recuperate the next day  if youre driving by new haven check to see if theyve brewed itcanned it the gent at the brewery said they brew it every month or so and usually run out of cans within a few days well worth the 1520 min detour from i95 if youre passing by,0.5130545735419686,0.9082
5372,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,750ml corked bottle from the lcbo served from the fridge best before date 02072020 i went into this so excited to try this beer the look was a beautiful dark pink colour and it smelled like a great combination of berries thats where things went sour literally i know that this type of ale is supposed to be tart and i was expecting that two other beer lovers tried this with me and we all felt similarly it tasted like red wine that had gone to vinegar i have tasted balsamic vinegars that i would prefer to sip i am hoping that i got a bad bottle but i fear that it wasnt the case it felt like it was wellbrewed but the taste was frankly revolting and i have had some bad brews in my day 100 disappointed,0.5129831537096806,0.015
915,Westly,2015 b2 had at apricot share with about 35 other apricot sours and siasons top notch apricot saison thought the finish is what separated it from other apricots great smell and terrfic light airy not that sour i woulds say this and la fosse b2 one the share for me i love fou but 15 was a little lack luster compared to westly,0.5128609721976506,0.6416
3989,Mexican Cake - Maple Bourbon Barrel-Aged,vintage 2018 drank on feb 17th 2020 im really impressed by the way in which the maple has held up in this beer  its not just an adjunct flavor but also a richness to the texture and mouth feel that make it different from the standard mexican cake or barrelaged variants the spices play surprisingly well with the sweetness of the maple  im really surprised by this in particular its not something that sounds great but the final product is quite good the barrel is very nice to boot  mellow bourbon smooth no alcohol burn  im really amazed by how reasonably this bottle was had  its a terrific beer and really should command more in trade,0.5127445389733255,0.9924
5835,Sang Noir,maybe this will grow on me but initial impression is too tart and acidic i prefer a duchess de bourgeouene or however tf its spelled i guess im a sour rookie,0.5126838069516721,0.3291
549,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,hell of a beer would i pay the crazy secondary price no very thankful a family member stood in line and got a bottle the only detractor with this beer was a soy sauce aroma after initial pour thankfully it wasnt present in the taste that was very much german chocolate,0.5126492091672302,-0.8776
1006,Zombie Dust,this is one of those must try beers to my knowledge so i figured its worth reviewing  look pretty standard but certainly hazier than i was expecting good lacing though  smell this is where it starts to lose me a little now it smells fine and all but for a pale ale its simply way too hoppy i almost thought i had gotten the style wrong when i smelled it  taste again this is not a pale ale its clearly an ipa with the level of hops going on here there is almost no focus on bringing the malts up front which is really what distinguishes the two styles for me pas can be hoppy even very hoppy but they need to also give attention to the forward malt flavor this beer only has a semblance of that i guess its more present than a typical ipa but hardly so and i would bet any beer drinker would label it an ipa if you gave it to them blind the taste isnt even bad but to be honest its a pretty standard fruity west coast style nothing special either hops arent particularly unique or interesting as it starts to warm a bit the malt comes in but right out of the can its almost completely absent  feel i find it has a bit more success here it isnt quite as heavy as a typical ipa likely thanks to the slightly lower abv on the other hand its still far too heavy for a pa  overall i like this beer however it simply doesnt work as a pale ale for me there are plenty of hoppy pas ive had that find that still manage to keep the malt characteristic of a pa this is not one of them again its too heavy as well either this beer should be labeled an ipa or brought down to something like 55 and given more malt focus i dont know why some breweries have these baffling mislabeled beers sometimes it puts a huge stain on what would otherwise be a fine beer the fact that this has the 1 spot for pale ales shows how biased some of the reviewers on this site are towards ipas it feels like it has that spot because its an ipa competing with pale ales almost like an 8th grader competing in the little leagues  regardless even if this were just called an ipa i still dont think it would be the 40th best beer in the world which is what this site seems to contend not sure where the obsession with this beer came from maybe its something before my time also a 6 pack of this is like 14 bucks when there are plenty of 11 six packs id say are way better,0.5126283480247659,0.9951
4907,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,16 may 2020  beer 95  ba top 250 alert  corona day 65  price 1999 lowry hill liquor in minneapolis current rank 184 on beer advocate  appearance 4  extremely black and a bit thin head fizzled away immediately  nose 5  nearly all sweet barrel good  taste 5  basically all barrel fruitier than some other big stouts for sure reminds me a little of surly darkness which can almost pass for a quad  mouth 4  thick and sticky but quite flat glides down the throat smoothly but i prefer more carbonation  overall 5  waited years to finally try this one will be sure to hunt it down again next time im in that part of the country  cheers,0.5125674959545296,0.9068
4935,Affogato,this is a review for the 2020 version that was dropped for a day i am sure this will get great reviews as with everything trillium but i think most good breweries brew better perhaps this ages better  looks great dark creamy little head that dissipates soon enough for an affogato it sets some expectations  smells good yes you get the coffee chocolate and vanilla but the smell gives you the first hint that this is going to be a disappointment stouts with lesser alcohol smell better and there are many good coffee and chocolate stouts out there  first taste is really good the smell has muted your expectations the vanilla is there the coffee not so much i am guessing they do that to get a better audience but this is an affogato with a blend of coffee theres more of chocolate notes so thats a plus the aftertaste is too sugary though by the second sip a pint seems like a lot but i have been served at the brewery and the taste doesnt live up probably needs less alcohol with less sugar and more of a mouthfeel to get a better balance and flavor profile  i can see that this was a great beer when it was introduced a few years ago but it needs an update the limited drop is a great way to get good ratings try this if you are in the boston area if you are making a trip head to wakefield in the opposite direction instead your local brewery probably makes a better pastry stout,0.5123301065797642,0.9967
4425,Hopslam Ale,a smells like victory s all the hops varietals in one sniff wow t ive tried this brew every year for 5 years 2021 issue is the perfect blend of all senses with an amazing after honey linger wow m thick juicy and satisfying o ive had a lot of dipas and this one hits the perfect balance wow you see it you buy it,0.5122321169097865,0.9819
2012,Resolute - Coconut,this beer is probably one of the best coconut beers ive ever had not probably it is the nose is absolutely incredible the huge mouthfeel of coconut is absolutely fantastic if you dont like coconut beers this beer is not for you if youre a fan of coconut beers this is absolutely one if not the best,0.5121291107827499,0.8297
5376,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,if this was one 330ml bottle maybe i could tolerate it more as is the sourness affects the teeth and gives acid reflux to regret too much looks and smells great but i wouldnt try again,0.5119779487495886,0.1655
2035,Keene Idea,not quite as good as bad boy but different and special in its own way another example of the great socal ipas that have a lot of hops but still make them drinkable and enjoyable,0.5117624394505965,0.8999
1944,Triple Sunshine,this is so extremely floral feel like youre chewing some flowers it is one of a kind i never find anything thats like it very sweet but you dont feel its overpowering on the other hand you still able to taste all the other complex flavors alcohol nicely hidden a beer that ill definitely miss,0.5116925577368446,0.9198
3323,Abrasive Ale,16 oz can from the wall of beer in clemson sc 489 with a november 2020 canning date stamped on the bottom pours with a slightly hazy amber colored body with a good white head this is a very good dipa but some 12 years after its introduction it is clearly overrated and over priced  for example i had an ipa yesterday that was about a good and cost less than half a much this ale does have an excellent smooth mouthfeel with well hidden abv,0.5116365390936795,0.9592
4012,The Abyss,2017 reserve im getting some bourbon and a moderate amount of bitterness which im attributing to the wine barrel feels experimental and i think its worth drinking at least once,0.5116360627776749,-0.2023
1561,Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),2015 vintage cracked this bad boy with some friends to celebrate the cubs win in game 7 since its a chicago area beer lots of chocolate and bourbon barrel here much much better than the standard dark lord swill which is overly sweet loved this one,0.5115811039802942,0.9458
856,JJJuliusss!,canned 51321  consumed 52521  high expectations here and luckily theyre met it looks beautiful smells amazing feels amazing and has a unique for me flavor profile with a perfect balance of bitterness and juiciness some 68 beers could leave me wanting more oomph but they hit the nail here this is why hazies rule now im glad i have 3 more cans and will look for it again,0.5114567257577319,0.9153
2420,§ucaba,bottle date 2018 palate contaminants other beer plus a nice fatty cheese  medium brown color and offwhite head lacing is present but doesnt last too long  first smell that hits me is flint thats odd scored sugar roasted pecans honeycovered this isnt the first time ive had this brew but i dont remember any of this  maybe i shouldve downed this one and bought a fresher bottle to review because it has been one of my favorites even if i havent had it in years i mean none of this rings the ol olfactory bell for me still i rate the first bottlecan thats possible for me so if theres wide dispersion in the quality then it is what it is  on the taste of this bottle if herbal rum were a thing this would be it right on down to the alcohol presence and i suppose you can kick in a little lactose butter variety its much more vegetative than i remember too its more bitter than most fw barrelaged offerings sweetness is moderate theres none of the savoriness that i remember  at least the build quality is still there good fine carbonation and theres a really pleasant woodynutty aftertaste good mediumheavy weight the overwrought alcohol presence is the only detriment  i need to revisit this one,0.5114207409208024,0.9559
5453,Coconut B-Bomb,2017  2018 batches were as good as advertised  not a stout but close to that with complexity   not coconut suntan lotion but just enough balance  certainly they are best fresh not 1 year aged,0.5113339700309388,0.9202
4210,La Fosse,finally got to rate this beer b3 from bottle to glass pours an opaque orange hue a lot like the juice very fruity on the nose the flavor profile to me is very similar to fuzzyi guess i should have an actual peach and apricot side by side to really know the difference which in the end is why i am rating it the same beautiful beer that i think side project has improved over previous batches as the acidity levels have gone down quite significantly in my opinion,0.5112652293609702,0.8591
1705,Green,canned 92220 tasted 11120 this is my least favorite of tree houses flagship offerings the most bitter of the bunch compared with haze sap julius and alter ego for some people that might be a strength but for me i would have liked more of a sweet and juicy backbone to balance out that bittnerness the look is appealing and the feel is very nice and smooth although has less of the fluffy character that i love in a number of th beers,0.5111764339644042,0.9638
1,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,this review is for the 2019 batch it was bottle number 43 tasted as part of a dinner at toppling goliath poured as dinner was served thick and almost black allowed to warm and enjoyed as dessert on the nose bourbon and maple syrup thick mouthfeel and full of flavor i have had the 2020 version on tap so comparing the two is difficult however i think the 2019 aged nicely and was in my opinion the better of the two,0.5111133925660474,0.8316
2822,Double Shot,nom nom nom nom nom i recently had tried triple shot on draft at tree house and brought back some cans of double shot to try at home triple shot definitely has more coffee flavor and was maybe a touch smoother but double shot is still phenomenal rich smooth and the booze is hidden perfectly a topnotch stout,0.5110987286158993,0.9393
1385,Aaron,certainly not a bad beer but i find barleywines too sweet for my liking and this one was no different i also didnt notice a massive difference between this and other barleywines from local brewers,0.5110615100141863,0.8113
620,Bourbon County Brand Stout,2020 excellent bcbs year the balance on this years og is excellent you get bourbon oak chocolate the chocolate really comes on strong after the finish well after drinking,0.5110332451977991,0.9196
2148,A Deal With The Devil,this is absolutely the most perfect barleywine that i have ever tasted if it wasnt so expensive i would probably drink nothing but this all winter barleywine is life,0.510933636581248,0.3876
1868,Haze,my first review ever and boy what a great one to start my impression was how fresh creamy hazy great combo of citrus and tropical with a nice finish great all around experience,0.510808310105511,0.9601
262,Very Hazy,looks and smells nice but i find the taste eh lacking something seems like the odd carbonationmouthfeel is hiding the hop character this beer wants to have  can dated 322  maybe it was much better freshor maybe treehouse is overrated,0.5107934858372881,0.5023
3030,Grey Monday,pouring from a 2016 750 ml bottle into a snifter this beer pours out very light in color for the style just like the rest of the series doesnt form a crown only an outer ring of bubbles attaching themselves to the glass the smell is big boozy raisins and plums with slight chocolate as well this whole series has had huge dark fruit notes it just smells like youre going to get drunk the taste comes in hot with booze and the dark fruit remains this is the version aged on hazelnuts but honestly how would you ever know with a beer this boozy i do think i like this one better than the rest but they just still dont hold up to the caliber i thought they would bring,0.5107216548193293,0.9321
6127,Darkstar November,2018 vintage enjoyed on election night 2020 cant remember who sent me this but won in a nfl bif from 2019 poured bottled into snifter has a bit of sweetness some spice good amount of chocolate and a boozy finish,0.5106680628685276,0.9464
3263,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,2017 vintage drank on 7817  this beer is the real deal and not overrated in any way its about 6 months old and drinking incredible the coffee presence is fantastic and some age would not necessarily hurt this either it was a pitch black and thick and creamy beer that came fully loaded with the flavors the barrel is perfectly present nothing too complex but by far one of the best coffee ba stouts out there elite,0.510585708971321,0.9116
5230,Sosus,22oz bottle  review from notes  ive been meaning to get my hands on this one a double ipa from one of my favorite ipamaking breweries and this doesnt disappoint with massive pine and floral notes smells and tastes like a bottle of pinesol  great stuff,0.5104778173321597,0.897
4688,Ground State,2018 bottle teku pour preface that i generally prefer ba stouts without coffee  l  fizzy translucent black with thick bubbly head looks very highly carbd  s  tastey aroma but hardly differentiated from a founders breakfast stout there is a little more sweetness which im getting maple from but is that the power of suggestion wasnt blown away by cbs but to memory i liked its aroma more note that im also getting cinnamon as it warms  t  oh damn thats sweet coffee is more muted than most which i appreciate the maple syrup is tough to find but its there somewhere i think the roast level is dark in the coffee and the malts the bitterness found is medium to high and begins to develop as it warms overall very rich in flavor  f  very highly carbd i would not define it as thick regardless of its sweetness and sugars feel is status quo and not necessarily anything noteworthy  o  solid beer top 250 beer that trades for 75 lol this is a hype beer and why i think im giving up trading at least for limited beers it is a good beer and id be happy to buy it once or twice at cost if i were local but for california to hype bottle logic to their value or florida to hype jwb or ac or my local brethren here in pa to hype voodoo to the tradde value that they soar to makes me just want to laugh if youre into paying for the name on things then the aforementioned breweries and many more are what youre looking for im more than over seeking out these super limited beers ill drink the few others i have in my cellar and stick to the equally tastey shelf beers,0.5104021511271102,0.995
985,Chemtrailmix,ive had the pleasure of enjoying chemtrailmix three years in a row now  the bourbon barrel variant in 2017 stands out to me the most as it doesnt have the same bite and spice of rye which i also happen to love with a bit of age the peppercorns mellow just slightly and the bourbon smoothly shines through back to back with barrelaged abraxas this is still a tough one to beat the cinnamon is far less present though and those peppercorns have more of a bite  even more so in the rye variants  chemtrailmix is worth every bit of the praise and hype that it receives its a bit of an adjunct overload when fresh and hot but its a stunner with a little age my love for this beer cannot be overstated,0.5103743973773082,0.9319
2001,Resolute - Coconut,l floaties doesnt bother me but a look very similar to prop 2013 motor oil s first take yielded fudge but during the second take is when the coconut explosion takes place coconut ended up dominating the nose over the fudge t just like the taste indicates tons of coconut but almost too much to where its difficult to enjoy the other components of the base beerbarrel aging f oily sticky but the carb did a nice job of making this smooth and dangerously drinkable overall this is one of the most authentic coconut stouts out there if not the single most authentic however i would have liked to have gotten more of the base beer instead of i thought i would never say this an overdominating coconut profile,0.510358669144102,0.8135
1409,Supplication,lucky enough to grab the last bottle at brick store pub atl for a pretty penny worth the money since this is unlike any beer that i have ever had unique base brown ale with drying vinous funk of the pinot noir barrels i think i prefer saison bernice slightly but this is essentially flawless,0.5103055447136203,0.836
2382,Miami Madness,wow total mango quava delight barely any head or retention but beautiful colors and fruity as can be on the nose and palate i poured in three separate phases to enjoy the spectrum clean first pour clean with dreads second pour and dread only third pour got to say i liked them all met the hype and worth the hunt,0.5102793918252967,0.9669
2875,Pirate Bomb!,pirate bomb is one of the many variants from prairie paa is one of my all time favorite breweries and i cannot get enough of prairie noir and vanilla noir  however i was shocked to find that pirate bomb was so off the mark the rum is insanely overpowering on the nose and especially on the flavor of the beer i felt like i poured the beer and than a shot of dark rum into a glass i know they were going for a rum kick but this was out of control  the sweetness of the beer is quite good but after a few sips the blanket of rum becomes unbearable  firesidewithphil,0.5102265208182855,0.8171
4127,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,went to boston from alabama with the express goal of getting the new england ipa experience this is an apa i know almost every ipa lived up to their hype however i must say this one was riding trilliums hype train that said everything else from trillium nailed it look moderately hazy darker orange with several smaller floaties only trillium beer tried with any distinguishable sediment still a very pretty beer smell citrus and earthy flowers no grass or weed taste citrus with significant bitterness not the juiciness found in their other beers feel great light body for an apa almost heavy enough for a lighter ipa overall definitely a great beer no doubt there i must say after having their other beers trillium offers significantly better one issue was that there was no date on the can but it was bought directly from the brewery so assumed a couple weeks old maximum if anyone in the southeast would like to know what this is like go grab a can of tropicalia from creature comforts thats what came to mind while drinking it,0.5098460244764775,0.9565
91,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,had on draft from a snifter at perennial l dark not totally black but close with a thin brown head s chocolot t very chocolate as well cinnamon rounded out at the end i didnt get a ton of heat when cold but the second half of my pour it comes out nicely at the back end and really augments the rest of the bear the whiskey is apparent throughout as well but not as some of their other barrel aged beers f viscous and in a way that works well with the beer o this was like drinking two different beers warm and cold which was awesome a nearly perfectly balanced beer and this coming from someone who usually doesnt like cinnamon in his stouts,0.5098451204090012,0.9827
414,Fou' Foune,2018 bottle sampled from a plastic cup at midnight in the parking lot of forager brewing awaiting nillerzzzzzcrema release the next morning i can understand why someone might like this style of beer but the sour notes of the belgian fruit lambics just are not my thing,0.5098305844599396,0.1901
1726,Beatification,bottle pour at the 2019 festival of farmhouse ales this one absolutely lived up the hype perfectly balanced the best sour beer ive had from russian river and that is saying something,0.509610776860613,0.9118
1127,V.S.O.J.,yeeeeeah look wise this is a joke looks like a watery 4 beer with giant bubbled head from an aggressively poured bud light seriously disappointing  smells exaclt like straight jacket so i dont know how to rate this straight jacket smells great but for a beer thats 5 times the cost id expect a little more yes omg or damn to hit me when i smell it  taste  haha alright you win revolution  feel  fucking hot not mad about that but damn it drinks like black tuesday  overall  ungodly hot and unworldly complex ill crack another and give it a real review in the upcoming few months,0.5095884635901692,0.9529
280,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),sickly sweet foul this is for college kids from vermont who like to clammer on about maple syrup and hippie culture the beer itself is so disgustingly sweet that you should get a blood test after drinking one to see if this swill gives you diabetes seeing a 100 next to this garbage only proves the point that the majority of craft beer drinkers are buffoons with no more integrity than a top notch brown nose pole polisher this is not beer,0.5095822518585446,-0.0232
51,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,2016 vintage  drank 022421  smell pleasant with notes of tobacco and chocolate  taste  the tobacco over powers this one in the beginning and then as it warms the peppers take over very unique taste and i think its the brandy barrel influence  feel  thin and i expected more  overall  for being the 4 overall beer on ba i expected more much more the feel was thin and notes of pepper overpowered this yet it was not completely unenjoyable just not even close to the 4th best beer in the world regardless glad i gut to try it as its always nice to see what the hype is about this one just didnt live up to it,0.5095388319880259,0.9371
1641,Black Tuesday,definitely one of those beers ive waited a long time to get found it in a 16 oz can ive had so happens its tuesday which i loved but this is my first of the original maybe 25 was too much maybe not well see in any case its the highest abv of any beer ive ever tried 17 was the highest ive sampled but this knocks that back a couple points ive got a 2020 bottle poured out into a snifter half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass receding into a thin collar of beige the smell is exquisite thats a strong word i know but i think it deserves that descriptor its full and strong bourbon and licorice and fig that stings the back of the nose as it goes in 5 on the smell love it lets sip now chocolate coffee caramel toffee licorice fig smoke char leather damn this is very comparable to bourbon county stout this has been barrel aged for a year and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way i had indian food for dinner and i love the layers indian has it seems to fill up every bit of my palate this beer is the same way it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor its also like indian because its got a spiciness to it that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me there is light carbonation and a medium mouthfeel not too thick and not too thin overall im very impressed with this and im glad i bought two cans of it this is the beer of a mature drinker this is the beer of a wise man this is the beer of a guy whos well traveled this is the beer of a guy whos got a financial plan this is the beer of a man with an important job this is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class this is the beer of a good father this is the beer of a faithful husband this is the beer of a youthful grandpa this is getting my top ratings what a way to celebrate fathers day 2021,0.5093964298003293,0.9976
1407,Supplication,it looks beautiful with light carbonation remaining after a pour the smell is a bit muted but you can smell a bit of funk theres so much happening in the taste the carbonation is spot on i dont taste outright cherries but i get the bret the funk is not incredibly strong but its there to keep things interesting this was bottled 12518 and i wonder how that has affected the taste its very smooth if it werent so expensive i could drink this all day long i am glad i have another bottle from my visit and im curious how a couple of more years will affect it,0.5093603870074283,0.8004
758,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,2016 bottle  wish i would have drank it fresh its not bad but theres very little on the seeet side to balance out a pretty intense coffee flavor  checks all the boxes but sadly there are comparable beers i can grab on the shelf,0.509344464957919,0.6678
5320,Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,jet black with a two finger head cinnamon is certainly present along with cacao and a little vanilla i get the touch of heat but booze as well the two together make this complex but a too much so it doesnt jive for me the way other jackies do but it is still quite drinkable and so i will,0.5093393121231888,0.5187
6199,The Streets,can dated 32017 this is the third can consumed and a revisit on 62317 whoa this got better with over 3 months of age on it from the pop of the can fruit juices hit the nose slight sediment when poured and a noce white head leaving spotted lacing the taste is straight hop juice and 0 bitterness the feel is full with a slight alcohol burn in the back but thats expected for a 10 abv overall it was awesome and my last can so hopefully they do this again,0.5093364766425711,0.9175
3749,Upper Case,had a freshy can thanks to my friend who graciously gifted me one since i threw a bunch of brews his way for a party when you open the can it doesnt just greet you with an aroma it jumps out and punches you in the face the flavor is wave upon wave of juicy and dank hoppy goodness its hard to describe all the flavors since its like describing the sound of a volcanic explosion really fucking loud i get a ton of tropical fruit with berries and dank resin mosaic plays the lead role with galaxy as an obvious supporting job serious body commands this to be sipped and enjoyed but i never got any booze heat or warmth overall this is my favorite trillium to date with galaxy cutting tiles coming in a close second  71718 can consumed on 72618 in a tulip glass,0.509315376593913,0.9573
3021,Grey Monday,tried 2015 in 2017 a heavy one for sure hazelnuts are my favorite but i barely picked them out nevertheless it was a tasty brew which i may have enjoyed more than its boozy black tuesday cousin,0.5093103329174943,0.7964
757,Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,2014 bottle poured into a kbbs teku on 31619 im thankful that this aged so well im sure the coffee flavor has subsided a little from its original flavor but to me that is a positive this beer is excellent,0.5088364410122919,0.9475
4386,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,a beer that lives up to the reputation ill get to the appearance at the end of the review mostly because the smell and taste are the two most important parts of this beer and for one other reason smell is boozy barrel up front with a healthy amount of warm apple to round it out taste is more balanced with the apple slightly leading the way and the boozy oaky barrel subtly surrounding it feel is medium bodied neither oily nor thicka perfect example of just right mouth watering drinks more like a nonbarrel aged 9 or 10 abv than a big bold 12  my only problem however was evident right off the open and pour i opened it and got hit with the apple and brandy before the cap came off but i didnt hear the usual noise one expects opening a beer because the one i had had little to no carbonation it has a nice dark hue with some brown edging but there was no foam and very little lacing if they date their beer with the first three numbers being the date this was bottled 92618 doing a little online research in october of last year there was a release by prairie that some of this beer was infected so i dont know if thats the case here but if this beer infected just means the loss of carbonation id take an infected version of it over a lot of other beers out there because this is phenomenal long time want glad i got it,0.5087895612238947,-0.9019
5177,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,from a can direct from the brewery first impression was this is no single ipa tastes heavy to me lush and potent bitter orange rind notes are most noticeable good amount of bitter lingering more than i expected finishes drier than i expected there is a strong mineral character an almost metallic tingle which for me takes over too much of the flavor here i was thinking this was a juicy neipa but citra commonalities aside this is a different animal im hoping it grows on me but it feels a bit one note im not blown away im maybe not as citracentric as others so i shouldnt be surprised that im not gaga over this i see why people like it but seems like a lot of hype surrounding this beer my issue is that it starts exactly where it ends it feels almost stingingly sharp with citrus like your tongue is being zapped but there isnt a depth to the experience or a nuance to the hop profile again one note i normally really like single hop ipas but i think ive learned that citra does not have what im looking for at least not when all by itself all that said it is excellent beer,0.5086657457872162,0.9701
4382,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,i have never really been a fan of the apple brandy ba stouts the apple character has always been an odd mix for me i got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because i love prairie and i knew people flip for this beer upon opening it the smell is very distinct and i just dont like it it smells the way its supposed to smell its just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me now on the tongue its a completely different story for me the apple is there but distinct and really appealing a tiny bit tart the stouts sweetness works well with this barrel it also helps for it to be a bit warmer too a great beer that changed my mind ive never had a beer with a smell that i didnt like end up being enjoyable before so a really fun beer,0.5086397345896583,0.9795
4460,Leaner,had side by side caseys leaner side projects had a bit more funk and layers to it but i preferred caseys powerful fruit notes both were fantastic,0.5084441246548441,0.8625
5714,Fort Point Pale Ale,traded for this a while ago as the date on the bottom of the can read 12417 with how about no written below that its easy to see how this would be trilliums flagship offering as this was quite heavy dank and tasty at the same time while being a good example of what an american pale ale should be even though this can was two years old it aged well and had very little sediment in it as the flavors held up quite well over time  this had a nice pour to it as the liquid was a quietly radiant apricot with a fair head topping it off a thin ring of lacing was left around the top of my pint glass as the faint collar was the best residue that i could find a few soapy sections remained as i worked my way through this but it was disappointing for something that was quite enjoyable lots of bright stone fruit peach wheat and white grape could be found in the varied nose as the taste had quite a range of flavors to it as well light wood citrus pith and a subtle earthiness could be found on the palate as this warmed up as i enjoyed the nuances of this beer moderately slick and lightly carbonated this felt like hawaiian punch in the aftertaste as the tropical and juicy notes lingered on my tongue once the liquid fully went down  not a lot of booze to this as this truly was an american pale ale and not an ipa that went by another name balanced in body there was little sediment in the liquid or at the bottom of my pint glass once i finished this off certainly enjoyable this wasnt a standout beer but had enough going for it that the hype wasnt entirely unjustified fans of trillium would be wise to see this out although its certainly not a hop bomb or full of dankness instead this was a beer that anyone could easily embrace since there was enough to like about it from the getgo,0.5084298406910598,0.9958
5450,Flora,on tap at festival of farmhouse ales 2015 this was first time trying flora i had previously had the blueblack variant while this doesnt quite reach the heights of ann and art it is a tremendous barrelaged saison wonderfully tart with a deep and complex flavor profile,0.5083757547508309,0.7948
5749,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),had a 2017 bottle poured into a teku and savored pours a little more viscous than most other beers which i regard as a good sign  it pains me to do it because i appreciate the effort that went into this beer but i rate it a category below world class  this is a big complex and great beer but it aims higher than it achieves the 3 main components of this beer are plainly evident immediately upon drinking it imperial stout honey and barrelaging this does give it a lot of complexity especially as is is complex to begin with and then you add honey and ba but one flaw is that these 3 elements do not combine together to create something new they exist side by side  another fault is the use of honey which doesnt work as well as you would like i love honey especially on hot biscuits where its cloying sweetness is the perfect foil to the starchy biscuit especially with butter with this beer you get just the cloyingness without really balancing anything the honey also adds a definite silkiness to the mouth feel some people no doubt really like this silkiness but id rather not have it  i cant help think that the use of a different more caramelized sweetener might have worked considerably better in fusing together the is and ba flavors to create something really special something like maple syrup or brown sugar instead of honey  on the plus side they held the honey back enough so that it is not a sweet beer it finishes with a strong and excellent bitterness it has a world class finish but then i remember the cloying honey flavor and that the ba flavors dont seem to add much but just go along for the ride and i realize there is room for improvement  i hope to be in truckee in december to try one of these on draft but i am not currently planing to acquire more of this one,0.5082430235137623,0.9958
1053,Doubleganger,alter ego turned up to 11 i actually like the more subtle characteristics of alter egos flavors but if youre looking for a juicy intense dipa look no further its what th does best,0.5082238081272611,0.7351
3645,Heavy Mettle,traded for this a while ago as the date on the bottom of the can read 11517 with ewwamamah written below that i dont know what that means or if that is a heavy metal reference but i can honesty say that this was a typical trillium beer that had all of their attributes present in it including an easy sense of enjoyment to it throughout my session  not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a muted honey with enough off to offset the the cloudy dull liquid even though that settled relatively quickly only a few spots of lacing was left behind as i worked my way through this as the residue on the side of my pint glass was quite disappointing tons of mango citrus rind booze and yeast filled the nose although they were quite muted from the first whiff onward dank pithy and strong tons of melon cantaloupe and kiwi came through as this warmed up but it was never easygoing enough for me to fully embrace this had a creaminess and slickness to it that saved it from being a disappointment but it needed more sugar and tangerine from feeling too heavy as the carbonation was nearly nowhere to be found  no doubt that this had enough alcohol to it and it seemed to complement the subtle hop burn quite well that wasnt what i was looking for as this beer put the heavy into heavy mettle tons of galaxy hops ensured that this would be a dank hop bomb but in the end this needed its rough edges rounded out a bit worth a go for those who love trillium but this didnt match up with their better and more popular offerings,0.5081848079095852,0.9887
443,Juice Machine,can dated 91520 poured into a small tasting glass  l dirty julius  s juice machine  they arent kidding i can practically smell the citrus from across the room  t king julius meets very green  f lingering finish where the very green aspect bitterness eventually takes over from the juice  o i liked this very much but it wasnt quite what i expected ths own description of king julius meets very green is apt im more team julius than team green so was expecting more of a fruit bomb that being said this is a very enjoyable beer if you dont mind a bitter finish after all the juice if youre looking for merely julius or king julius on steroids youre going to be slightly disappointed,0.5081378693694406,-0.227
4366,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,galaxy is not one of my favorite hops  ill be honest and just throw that out there  that being said there are things about galaxy that i do like quite a lot when combined with other hops it tends to be a smorgasbord of sweet clean rich haze cutting tiles delivers in spades  its almost too sweet but it doesnt quite cross that border in to syrupy which is good  i cannot abide that in an ipa the beer is still plenty drinkable and doesnt have that filling quality that i hate the bubble gumcotton candy tasty that many attribute to galaxy is not all that forward  its there but not offensive or overwhelming  id generally prefer a fort point  but this specific variant of cutting tiles is quite good,0.5081040269536057,0.9234
3736,Upper Case,exceptional hope load great lupulin bitterness but balanced the only way i can fault upper case is that it seems a tad watery and could be a little hazier  related i supppose,0.5080719519290676,-0.1585
5709,Fort Point Pale Ale,one of the beers that started it all for me not quite as tropical as youd think but still juicy hazy by no too heavy good beer i could drink a few of these,0.5079690783658116,0.2617
2327,Breakfast Stout,definitely has a raisin type smell the flavor follows suit but you can distinguish the chocolate initially and the coffee on the backend i like this beer but its not as complex as some of the other founders which some may appreciate but i for one enjoy the mirage of flavors not a bad beer just simple maybe if i had tried this before i tried so many of the other breakfast stout variants i would have a different opinion,0.5079047099260923,0.957
48,Marshmallow Handjee,2018 bottlesilver wax the hype is real been wanting this for as long as i can remember glad i finally got a chance to try a hefty pour at a nice share it stole the show around a bunch of big beers its crazy how much this tastes like toasted marshmallow fluff zero heat and smooth as hell,0.5078564819941737,0.5423
5434,Flora,wow this is easily the best sour ive ever had pours bright red in the glass with a trace of head hill farmstead funk without being overpowering loved it,0.5077172908920435,0.8794
3466,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,2014 review its boozy but im no way does this compare to todays barrel aged beers or flavored barrel aged stouts this is crap boozy and messy low grade fuel and gtfoh with stupid old money v new money comments,0.5074903830939168,-0.9493
482,Very Green,bought fresh at the brewery on 521 this is truly an incredibly made beer it kind of reminds me of the first time i tried king sue when i first got into ipas  it has the same general qualities of drinkability and flavor burst i dont know how tree house makes this drink so smooth,0.5074883775180962,0.6369
189,King Julius,im going to have to check what i gave doubleganger as it is still my favorite but this is darn close the hop bill is just amazing and i like the flavors on the nose orange mango even a hint of peach with absolutely full body,0.5071792944638996,0.8873
208,King JJJuliusss,i dont know why but im partial to the std julius this king version is fantastic and an awesome treat but maybe just a tad overworked on my palate yes it is hopped but the citrus tropical notes come through clear,0.507151077107623,0.9721
2843,Samuel Adams Utopias,2007 vintage  first opened july 4 2021  review on july 6 2021  this beer looks thick as heck while pouring its a redbrown color coming from the bottle theres no head at all which doesnt surprise me one bit based on the age and abv the nose is out of this world in a way to me it smells like a fine bourbon very boozy first off i get tons of caramel toffee chocolate raisin plum and so much more that i cant fully describe this is an outstanding aroma taste  i know i wont do justice to this  chocolate is up front as is the raisin and plum it then goes to the back to toffee and caramel im also getting vanilla in the mix this is really only a small portion of the flavors im getting overall but i just cant put words to them body  up front theres a bit of a burn from the alcohol but way less than the abv would suggest it then turns to a smooth almost creamy feeling that is so smooth and easy drinking this is worth the hype and im so happy i got the chance to get a bottle being in the liquor business now im going to try to get another the next time it comes out just to see the difference between vintages,0.5067876404047292,0.9571
4316,Bad Boy,probably my favorite beer that ive had from alpine danky pine and citrus goodness with a good mouthfeel and crisp finish i now understand what ive been missing and thankful for them bottling this and for the awesome trader that sent this my way one step closer to dying happy,0.5067193760029564,0.9595
494,Very Green,one of the most dynamic taste experiences my mouth has ever encountered the crack of the can unleashes a plethora of tropical notes and piny scents its incredible and enough to fill the room the taste profile mirrors the aromatic experience it starts out in the tropics and then transitions to a dense pine forest i mean im not kidding when i say this its as if you crashed into an evergreen and you have to pick the needles out of your teeth finally this beer smacks the back of your throat with an extremely intense hop bite that fads into a smooth finish begging you you to grab the glass and bring it to your lips once again i cant underestimate how lovely this beer is its bold its tasty and its an experience your mouth wont soon forget,0.5066971159875989,0.6454

3470,Kaggen! Stormaktsporter,i dont review often but when i do its alexandria whaelz huge thanks to bill a for sharing this drank along side the non barreled version bottle from 2007  a  very dark brown bordering on completely black medium tan head that lingers for awhile i should have used a different glass im an idiot  s  not a ton going on here a good amount of roast some oaky vanilla notes that come in secondary as the bottle warmed up i got the burgundy pepper as described below  t  strap in the roast is all up front until an amazing mocha blast in the mid palate the ending is some vanilla and barrel there is a slight earthy pepper type of thing going on during the finish the only time i have experienced something similar is in a handful of other barrel aged beers and in aged red burgundys its awesome though  m  rich and creamy without bogging down the beer at all intensely drinkable for the barrel and style and abv zero alcohol on the back end  o  this was amazing its been one of my top wants for years and i wasnt sure id ever get a chance to try it to be able to do it back to back with the regular version really showcases what the barrel does to this beer it truly is a shame that this beer is so incredibly limited and expensive i will forever be indebted to bill for allowing me to try this with him,0.5066264250744976,0.9875
1906,Chocolate Rain,pouring a 2017 bottle from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass this beer just like black tuesday pours out way lighter in color than expected when pouring a stout of this nature mediumdark brown color with highlights all the way through on the pour as quick as bubbles could form they would pop eventually the carbonation got ahead of the disippation and formed a thinner light tan crown the smell is quite demanding and confident with booze and alcohol it burns the nostrils and honestly doesnt leave much else to show you along the way the taste comes in more inviting showing you smooth chocolate and vanilla while still having a rather pronounced burn i do enjoy the thickness of the body to these but i will say that i wish this and black tuesday were both more complex they really arent blowing me away i get it its impressive they made a 20 stout blah blah blah but i still want it to have complexity and blow me away and these just havent been,0.5066015376725947,0.9372
813,Blessed,from tavour refrigerator kept since purchase not as thick as some describe pitch black and silky except for the coconut floaties which for me detract some from the appearance smell is divine  what id imagine it might smell like inside the factory where they produce mounds candy bars taste almost matches the smell except it is a touch too sweet and lacking enough barrel heat to balance it out overall i need to knock it down only because the drinking experience doesnt meet the price of entry considering that id be much happier with a 750 ml bottle of shared coconut vibes,0.5065635904914513,0.9313
5759,All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,one of the best stouts ive ever had just so drinkable creamy coffee and chocolate just dance on the palate like a fluffy pillow outstanding my rear end would need its own zip code if i had ready access to this,0.5065513551662015,0.9217
586,Double Sunshine,an excellent excellent beer but for my taste not as good as most ratings im not slamming this beer at all im just saying that there are many of this style that are more balanced and generally more drinkable,0.5064535063443049,0.1508

1365,Rare Scooop,reposted review from duplicate entry original review based on draft scores for the bottle are virtually the same although i might edge up the taste to a 475 as the bottle seemed to be even more integrated than the draft  cmon what did you expect when two southern lords from house barreltheon formed an alliance in st stoutsberg with a legion of adjuncts at their disposal not even the band of soulless muleriding shitlords could take away the enjoyment of this neapolitan treat  a black like john snows cold dead eyes a half inch head of dothraki shaded foam quickly decapitates itself into a thin ring   s strawberries stand proud and pert like dragon lady breasts emerging from a chocolate malt funeral pyre as the flames recede the oak vanilla and sweet molasses kneel in humble observance  t sweet sam malone what the hell is a cheers reference doing in here decadent chocolate coated strawberries painted with a fine brush of candied bourbon  f thicker than gregor cleganes quads  o a damn tasty beer worthy of the mighty hype throne upon which it currently rests ah hell you be the judge but if youre a kingslayer or just like sweet sipping dessert stouts think bramblebackyardlife is like then youll be hard pressed to find a better beverage to enjoy when winter comes,0.5061637238326621,0.9718
5632,Bourbon Barrel Champion Ground,happy halloween  i bought this a while ago in a bottle shop when it was too hot to enjoy a big barrel aged stout so nows the time poured a 127 ounce bottle into a dfh tulip and the head just didnt measure up over a blackish brown body so it gets nicked for that smell is of a generic brand jackie os stout which is a pretty high standard but they have a certain sameness to them albeit on a high plane i hope this is making sense to someone whos experienced this they loaded this up with jamaican blue mountain coffee which coffee wise is out of my not cheap range so its present in the smell and taste but not to an obnoxious degree instead things are nicely balanced mouthfeel is just fine for a barrel aged stout  this has been a good experience despite my lower than average scoring,0.5061622290165751,0.9853
5010,Gueuze 100% Lambic,amazing beer cantillon always knocks it out of the park lambics are great in general but theirs are the best more easy drinking than some lambics love it,0.5061125363127855,0.9714

5277,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),big upgrade over original dorothy in my opinion the wine barrel add so much complexity and this was perfectly carbonated as well not a lot of bells and whistles with adjuncts and or fruit being added just a beautiful barrelaged saison,0.5052810190399268,0.91
247,SR-71,this hits all the right notes super thick stout sweet but not crazy sweet toppling goliath has done it again this is nearly perfect in all aspects i wish this was widely available,0.5052699891717924,0.9142
4102,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,looks great and smells ok but compared to ddh fort point this is kind of a letdown bought in boston and drank fresh sidebyside with ddh fort point and ddh stillings street this was the worst of the threebut still an overall great trillium beer,0.5052594517179492,0.7269
3236,In Perpetuity,first i was struck by the lack of head on the beer then it was lighter than some of the other beers but the aftertaste had a certain bitterness,0.5052212268179676,-0.4678
1862,Sip Of Sunshine,first time seeing lawson in my local six pack shop great tasting hop profile smooth herbal dank yet balanced kind of worth the hype but to me i could probably find smoother local ipas still was glad to pick one up for around 5 bucks to try,0.5051640760249666,0.7816
61,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,2016 batch 2 reviewed  hunahpus is one of those beers that i loved the very first time i tried it and ive been chasing that dragon ever since unsuccessfully as it turns out  ive been lucky enough to try barrelaged huna twice now  once at great american beer fest and for a second time when i won a bottle in a charity raffle as it turns out i drank my ba huna alongside of double barrel huna expecting that i would be blown away by the double barrel in fact it was the exact opposite experience  and perhaps i should have expected that given the barrels used in db huna  rum and apple brandy barrels dont often tend to impart much thickness to a beer and in combination they definitely made the beer seem a bit thin additionally where the bourbon barrels in ba huna add depth richness sweetness and complexity it seems that double barrel just took on thinness and acidity its also quite charred in taste  it reminded me quite a bit of my gripes with 2018 huna sadly all of that cinnamon and vanilla that i love seemed to be entirely absent its still a sweet beer but its greatly overshadowed by the barrel notes and char and acidity  in the end i honestly think ive found myself preferring nonbarrelaged huna as my goto its certainly easier to get and something about it is just a much more pleasant experience for me yes i have a sweet tooth so thats probably a big part of it or perhaps cigar citys aging methods just arent to my liking maybe the barrels tough to say  more experimentation required,0.5049959813028356,0.9879
1245,Anabasis,4 a lot of barrel presence i agree with others that mentioned a port like presence with a welcomed dryness and softmedium amount of sweetness phenomenal stuff,0.504883945556912,0.8625
611,Bourbon County Brand Stout,have had several years vintages of this outstanding brew while it packs quite a punch it is delicious to drink usually make a point of grabbing several bottles when in the windy city,0.5048478739094556,0.8573
5152,Clare's Thirsty Ale,had a 10 oz pour straight from the tap yesterday looks like a standard ba stout with minimal head and pitch black i can tell the base is a very solid ba stout adjunct aside this one isnt heavy on the barrel and i dont love the idea of raspberry but it goes great this beer,0.5048070181615644,0.8379
3734,Double Stack,every summer i make this frustrating mistake of thinking that im actually going to spend the entirety of the three four high climate months crushing can after can of refreshing pale ales or ipas this misconception usually results in me doing something stupid like buying multiple four packs of the same beer thinking that the hot weather will help me power through the beers and make them feel enjoyable all at the same time while completely discounting such variables as 1 the fact that the human appetite decreases during warmer seasons 2 my taste buds seem to get burned out from hops a lot faster in the summer and 3 regardless of the season im usually too tired to drink a large quantity of beer after work so i tend to reach for the higher abv beers than the lower  so until those three variables are somehow resolved internally i usually find myself doing the exact opposite of what i think i would normally be doing in terms of drinking during the summer months instead of crushing session ipas wheat beers and bretty saisons i end up fruitlessly trying to solodome bombers of ba stouts and passing out with over half the beer still left in the glass or drinking one 12oz bottle of a high abv stout and trying to start another lower abv ipa and then passing out with over threefourth of the beer still left in the glass or actually finishing two tall boys of an ipa going to bed at like 1230 am and waking up tired and hungover  my idiosyncratic drinking habits formed from my highly functional alcoholism aside it seems like a single 16oz can of a moderately high abv stout is usually right around my happy spot of where i want to be when im too tired to do anything productive yet not tired enough to go to sleeplucky for me my favorite brewery has made the ingenious decision of canning their most famous beer in tall boy format unlucky for me its so rich its almost taken me 5 weeks to finish a fourpack by myself  when i heard that mikerphone and great notion were brewing beers together i was kind of hoping that their love child would be a cross between smells like bean spirit and double stack kind of like what eviltwin did with westbrook with imperial biscotti mexican cake break but with less spice and more maple and much less sticky cloying sweetness toward the back i think they ended up putting out some strawberry ipa which i didnt try because well strawberry and ipa are not two words i ever want to see in the same sentence as well as an imperial stout with peanut butter and marshmallows because i think the bottles were only put out in chicago and it was only briefly on tap if ever  if you havent gotten the hint by me wasting all this comment space while writing absolutely nothing about the actual beer itself its because theres nothing really to write about this beer its coffee maple syrup pancake batter and done for posteritys sake i will go on record and point out that the beer also contains minor notes of whole grain pancakes which contains halfassedly molten dark cacao chocolate chips but maple and coffee definitely are the two incredibly bold takeaways from this beer and for anyone to miss it theyd have to absolutely no functional smell and taste receptors in their body at all  compared to previous batches however the body has become a lot more enjoyable and by that i mean that it feels less like syrup and more like 99 humidity while being 102 outside on your skintongue ive either become more accustomed to bold sweet flavors or great notion has wisely dialed down the pastrystout a little compared to their previous batches so that even sugar averse sippers like myself can reach the bottom of the can albeit very very slowly  i honestly dont know how im going to finish the last remaining can inside my fridge,0.5047918311269416,0.9954
6208,Second Fiddle,great beer great hit of fresh hop aroma on opening also a fan of the regular ipa from them my local beer store metrowest massachusetts has both regularly and they are usually one to two weeks from canning not too boozy for a 82 so be forewarned  ,0.5047359171127892,0.9153
6128,Darkstar November,dsnthe first ba release from bl before fo explored into the scene of june 2015  dsn has always been under the radar as its not a pastry stout  i dont get the complex flavors as others molasses  chocolate etc  i can detect barrel  rye which is just about enough  ive had them fresh and aged imo better at fresh  1year not 15 years at that point flavors are muted,0.5045628408817776,0.8512
4088,Double Dry Hopped Melcher Street,tastes like orange juice mixed wbeer not bad at all not sure about a perfect 100 but its good smells a little musty mine was canned on 112619 so its about 3 weeks old already not bad but the perfect 100 it is not the bissell brothers swish is much better,0.5044502382852585,0.9685

3058,Cable Car Kriek,had this multiple times reviewing the most recent one ive had  toronado sd not available anymore though   thankfully this bottle was not a gusher nice pop to the cork though served in a wine tulip the bottle was chilled down considerably and had not been moved around much at all  the carbonation was generous but not overly so it definitely subdued after sitting in the glass a bit the smell is of tart cherries slight amount of funky earthybarnyard to it  the beer itself tastes very fruity more sour than i remember it in past bottles and resembles more like a great american wild than the tart cherry soda it could have passed for a year ago  mouthfeel is excellent lightly mouthpuckering with the the carbonation makes it quite refreshing i never get sick of this beer probably responsible for at least half a case of it purchased onsite for consumption  overall ive noticed that the bottles at toronado that had sat in their keg room undisturbed for a year have all turned out quite wonderful i havent seen a cable car kriek gusher since the release day back in august last year not that it matters anymore but if anyone has bottles floating around in their cellars id probably leave it undisturbed for a while before opening to make sure you dont lose any of this awesome sour,0.5042817693082724,0.9936
371,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Laird's Apple Brandy Barrel,humongous thanks to justing for sharing this who wouldve guessed that id get to taste it again the next day thanks dave enjoyed on 727 at top hops at a mini tasting with some awesome bas hell of a night and kicked off a wonderful weekend of beer tasting ticked from a 2oz pour and then adjusted my thoughts the next day from a larger pour  a  has that hunah look coats the glass with a single swirl no head but just a gorgeous beer  s  smells like hunah but with a strong raisin and fig some booze and some brandy basically hunah with some fruitiness a la sangria  t  oh wow hunah extreme figs with apple brandy you get the peppers on the finish but the fruitiness of the brandy just pushes this amazing beer to the next level truly amazing  m  smooth and creamy wonderful like a milkshake of amazing beer  o  wow what can i say this beer is simply amazing on friday when i sampled it i said i would do dirty things for this beerand then the next day i traveled 2 hours to another tasting which was before a third tasting in 2 days and this was a pleasant surprise at the 2nd tasting i guess the dirty things means dealing with nyc transit in horrendous heat and downpours and then having to leave one of the most epic tastings to go to another tasting what a weekend not sure how long these growlers will hold out but drink them upas of a few days ago this was the nectar of the gods,0.5042794557706214,0.996
701,KBS,this smells amazing but im not getting any barrel its very very subtle this reminds me of what id want big bad baptist to be the coffee is super there but idk i preferred the mackinac fudge one this is definitely top notch ill have to try it again i think this one hundred percent tastes and feels great regardless i guess i was just hoping for a smidge more balance but who knows maybe next bottle definitely still a nice treat it just tastes a ton like breakfast stout could have used a smidge more barrelboozy undertones,0.5041261006703084,0.9839
1839,Swish,traded for this a while ago even though i have no idea when since there wasnt a date or anything else written on the bottom of the can i havent had much from bissell brothers but the beers ive been able to sample from then have led me to believe that they can brew a new england ipa as well as anyone and that was certainly the case with this beer  the pour to this was decent as the liquid was golden murky and topped off with plenty of head not a lot of lacing was left behind as i worked my way through this with much of it remaining as the thin head along the top of my pint glass the strength of this beer as well as its potency lay in its taste as the tropical murkyand turbid nose gave a hint of what was to come once i sipped it melongrass dank hops and overt overripe tropical fruit in the nose gave me a hint of what was to come as the dry chalky nature of the aroma gave me a strong hint of what was to come tropical fruit soft juiciness and soft hops hit my palate from the getgo and lingered throughout my session as they formed the backbone of this beer a light carbonation and moderate alcoholic presence allowed the deep and dank notes of this fully emerge on my palate as this quietly lingered and fully warmed up to my tongue and ultimately to the rest of my senses  this had enough alcohol in it but that was nearly irrelevant to everything else that was going on sure lots of sediment was left at the bottom of my pint glass but that paled in comparison to the impression this left on me once the liquid fully went down while not among the best new england ipas or best ipas that ive had as of late this served as a textbook example of how wonderful this style could be if you love brews from this neck of the woods or anything fron bissell seek this out it will be well worth your effort,0.5040725235012632,0.9924
643,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),delicious all the hype well deserved the main thing for me is the creamy feeling and how smooth the taste i really cant say i have experienced that with any other beer,0.5039921417842147,0.743
9,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,is this the best beer in the world many would argue that is true while trying on draft at toppling goliath its hard to imagine the rich smooth sweet maple balanced by coffee could be all be pulled off the nose staining the glass and the flavor and taste to be met with fireworks from the grand finale,0.5039569302923801,0.93
613,Bourbon County Brand Stout,always a solid 45 great barrel even now that it is mass produced also a great beer to use in a french press with other things like cinnamon toast crunch easily one of the best shelfies to pick up it is a thick beer that has a great barrel smell to it and a nice thick mouth feel the look isnt anything out of the ordinary other than slightly more brown foam to it that i noticed more,0.503856408063353,0.9771
2113,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,not going to get to technical on this one dark minimal head smooth moderate to full mouth feel thats said big vanilla and bourbon on the nose on the palate forward and on the finish awesome havent had the base vanilla shake yet but its chilling in the cellar really looking forward to it even more now that ive had the bb edition,0.5036154747514601,0.2617
4041,Double Nelson,very good ne style ipa that is hazy unfiltered ipa which is in fact brewed in ne its called double nelson so ill assume theyre really trying to focus on the nelson sauvin hop that white wine flavour which accompanies this hop is the primary hop flavour in the profile and ive been somewhat put off by this in the past especially with brut ipas but here it is really well done leading to a very nice flavour smooth mouthfeel and pleasant sweet finish to each sip hill farmstead is off the beaten path not the greatest to get to  my god do they take their damn time getting the line up to move through their brewery i would say treehouse or the alchemist can move people through about 3 times as fast with the same number of staff so while i have enjoyed the hill beer ive had i doubt ill make it back there again,0.5035442630633122,0.6446

1394,Supplication,im probably being a little generous here with the rating but this is hands down the best beer ive ever tried found it in the back of total wine in the keg cooler walked through the plastic curtains with the sensor lights flicking on to be greeted by this gem limit 2customer a sign read being the only beer brand back there it felt like i stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore and with 100pt rating i just had to try it im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100 and made me realize beers can be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits i mean i made an account and am here now because of it right  served chilled in a frosted pint glass brick redorange colored head came less than 14 inch up when i poured first sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker mild notes of cream and white wine from the pinot noir barrels im guessing very light taste of grain not yeasty though or overpowering a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing taste great all the way through to the end almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo i think itd pair well with a topanade seafood grilled food  chimichurri or tapas as i said best beer ive ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world now ive got to try the rest of the line up at russian river brewing co ive had other specialty beers and they never really moved me like this did this one is definitely unforgettable not a pro in the slightest and this is my 1st review so take my opinion with a grain of salt i just had to put in my 2 cents because this is truly amazing,0.5032857157246554,0.9957
242,SR-71,prior to tasting i wanted to hate it i wanted to love it it looks perfects smells nice nice mouthfeel and tastes delicious it may be the bar for a barrelaged stout perfection its hard to describe im not wowed but at the same time its subtle rounded and wonderful im going to side by side w 2016 bcbs in a minute back my hunch was bcbs was a similar beer from memory its not sr71 crushes it,0.5032353174533245,0.9423
3700,Congress Street IPA,yeah my can of this is old  really old 72116 but this is a classic and i vowed to have it along with everything else in my basement before it burst or broke even though this was quite a bit of a malt bomb when i opened it it wasnt bad and was still enjoyable to a large extent very little sediment was poured out as well which made the experience that much better  not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a muted peach with a ton of cloudiness to it the head was sufficient and there was a bit of lacing here and there after the thin collar at the top but it wasnt terribly thick or bright not a lot of pine in the nose but there was enough orange tangerine and cream in the nose to keep this soft the clementine and rind came through in the taste along with a citrus sweetness that made this quite soft and easy to drink a mild dank hop presence came through in the aftertaste and it was no secret that this felt like a malt bomb given how much was in here loads of wheat gave this body as this was not terribly juicy nor dry from start to finish  just the right amount of alcohol was present too as i felt a bit of warming but not enough to serve as a deterrent this was a nice beer that had everything in proportion and was quite easy to quaff i have no idea who paul and jess are but if they had this at their wedding it would have been a great choice,0.5032145101093196,0.9919
4889,Aurelian Lure,hit of what im coming to understand is trademark jk funk which is to say a little outhousey for me but that settles down over time on the palate some light nectary apricot and a robust acidity that causes some throat burn by the end of the glass a solid sour but nothing worth going out of your way for,0.5031895958421969,0.5348
413,Fou' Foune,right up front i will say that i am not a huge fan of sour beers i find them a bit bracing and not the kind of beer i enjoy drinking having said that i do find them an interesting category and this one while a bit puckering was not as sour as some of the sour beers ive tried  it has almost a champagne shandy type of mouthfeeltaste its light and crisp the way a champagne is and has a similar carbonated consistency the color is nice with a dark yellow color and little bubbles which fizz within it  the taste is a very fermented peach flavor tart and acidic but not so much so that you lose the nuances of the apricotpeach i did something i never do with a sour and had a glass and a half of this in one sitting probably more to do with the price and scarcity than the taste as rare as this is i probably wont get another chance to try it  and i am actually quite okay with that  this is a conversation beer  someone who enjoys sour beers might argue differently  but as a sour skeptic i can appreciate the time up to two years aging this and know that the french do not mess around when it comes to great beer and wine production this is no doubt of the highest quality you can buy the only issue i had is that for the price and rarity the bottle looks very cheap it reminds me of a bottle of sparkling apple cider youd buy at the store for 3,0.5031847095564335,0.9584
5794,Emerald Grouper,beer looks okay but it tastes kind of like old garbage hops that someone forgot about and tried to use i was excited to try this but it was a huge let down,0.5031290384485707,0.8523
4742,Maple Bacon Coffee Porter,this is the best beer ive ever had  and this coming from an ipa guy i bought a 4pack on my way out of the brewery and tried my first one at a resort i was on vacation so my senses may have been slightly skewed but this is fantastic stuff though not cheap i tried about 5 or 6 beers on draft not all full beers and purchased 3 beers to take home and this was the best although the chocolate cherry cordial was close behind  the sweet sugary maple flavor hits you right away and then the bacon sort of creeps up on you the coffee is an undernote which is much appreciated i find most coffeebased stouts go way over the top tasting more like weekold truck stop coffee forgotten and left in the pot for days i love that the maple syrup and the bacon are the stars of the show and the coffee just kind of pops in like a sip of java here and there between breakfast bites  the beer mouthfeel is rather light but smooth and that scored it the only 475  it is brownblack and has a light head as i was on vacation i had no tulip or teku for this and instead used a stemless wine glass from the resort even still the odor was a sweet and salty umami blend  you guessed it maple syrup and bacon  i kick myself for not bringing more of this home in my luggage this is the best tasting beer ive tried if you are drinking for merely a buzz probably not for you as i had two and did not feel much,0.5031192773675841,0.9921
725,Duck Duck Gooze,the 2016 is on point right now very complex sharp and interesting wine barrel aged sour if you havent had a chance its very much worth seeking this beer out,0.5030763766791959,0.4833
101,Heady Topper,great brew very tasty and loaded with a good variety of hops rare which is why i was so grateful to acquire two 4packs not the best beer i have ever had  personally i think focal banger is better focal banger is in my top 5 would buy focal banger again would not buy heady topper again,0.5029754094323834,0.9042
628,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),usually i blindtaste beers but ive read so much about this one over the years i certainly know of its reputation that said beyond being a monastic quad i do not presently recall any specific pointsfeatures of this beer and have not read any reviews below yet i dont know what to expect am i 100 honestly going to find this a score100 beer this is my 2000th beer ratingreview so it had to something with the prospect of wowing me fingers crossed l dark chestnut redbrown pours with minor haze with some sediment left in the bottle head forms swiftly take the pour slowly 3cm pale tan head ps10mins a patch of bubbles holds the whole way down s quite malty with a light hint of spice t woah ok well that got my attention instantly deep and roastyrich notable abv brushing my palate and a good balancing hoppybitter aspect into the finish f big rich  visible abv but well balanced by hops o made for slowsipping lovely complex and big yet mostly refined the abv is unusually loud for 102 and that surprises me i had an 181 yesterday less shouty on the palate than this one fwiw im tasting this on a clean palate my wife tried it after eating chocolate and didnt get the abvzing nice would i drink it again yes if i could drive to the brewery and buy it for peanuts worth the aftermarket price certainly once reviewscoring all done now the reveal i get to read the bottle lables to see what i missed 330ml bottle bb xx012026 euro1600 bought from xx shopbelgium as part of a large pickyour own consignment to london the xxs being to anonymise people who perhaps have breached their required agreement with the brewery not to resell this beer,0.5029597303789278,0.9964
2472,Sunday Brunch,big like hulk when he borrowed barry bonds vitamin supplements huge im talking huge coffee flavor like a hungover sunday at starbucks but this beer wasnt brewed with starbucks this is quality hipster coffee just like the dork that lives below you who rides a fixie to work that being said the only thing that raul isnt feeling is the sweet maple syrup cause your boi aint into sweetness also i wish the mouthfeel in the end was a lil more viscous its not bad its not martha hunt super model skinny but id prefer if it was ashley graham large  yep,0.5029561729293166,0.8875
3614,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,2009 sticker cork seemed to have dried out when i opened the bottle some of the beer was on the inside of the cap the cork was all wet  orange color with a white head that diminishes quite fast i guess because of the open air cork this is exactly what you want to smell from a gueuze huge array of complexity right up your nose funk slight acetic acid lactic acid one of the deepest layered flavors ive ever had in a gueuze so much going in there but at the same time so mellow this bottle was a real treat  we can see how cantillon moves up their game with their lou pepe series,0.5029132525075086,0.6542
268,Very Hazy,was lucky enough to obtain this via a trade recently as this was one of the few popular offerings from tree house that i had never reviewed on here before love the haze and this was on par with it although i thought it was a bit overrated needless to say thats only because of the insanely high standards that this brewery has set as it wasnt because this was a letdown in any way shape or form  of course this had a dank golden hue to it with a nice head topping it off as it had the look of any typical juice bomb from new england a little bit of dark sediment settled at the bottom but it wasnt noticeable as i swirled this as the liquid was nearly uniform in hue lovely lacing down the side of my pint glass as the rings were deep and welldefined along the top half of my pint glass with thicker sections of rings below that lots of melon honeydew and tangerine juice in the nose as the taste was just as exotic and juicy on the palate a bit of grapefruit tang and dank hops emerged as this fully warmed up as the malt was quite basic and recessed at the same time some hefty pine and tropical fruit rind emerged in the aftertaste but overall this went down easily as everything melded well together  hard to detect the alcohol here but it was present enough as i warmed up nicely once i finished this off canned on 1219 with yes indeed written above it this was a solid beer but a bit too green dank and overripe for me to rate any higher on here its easy to see why this is so highlyregarded on here and any fan of tree house would be wise to seek this out i certainly wouldnt mind giving this another goaround,0.5027063143760891,0.9919
4530,Impermanence,mmm yummy lactose sigh why not throw some exlax in ther with it i hear it comes in chocolate flavor these days aside from that goddammmm this shit is good and its like eight months old they put out such exceptioinal stuff lets see how the bowels handle it tonight though bottle logic lactose stouts tear my ass up,0.502665606600698,0.0387
5191,Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,this is a dandy i am a big fan of this style and this is the first time i have tried a ten fidy by oskar blues it was part of a christmas treasure trove of beers from my wife and mother in law merry christmas to me it has great foamy head retention and it pours an inky viscous black the flavors blend beautifully and although the bourbon alcohol flavor is prominent it isnt overpowering and allows the other flavors to shine through this is a really well crafted stout and i will be adding it to my list of favorites well done ob,0.5026602625127112,0.976
1997,Resolute - Coconut,one year aged on tap at the brewery its very good and the coconut flavor is strong and not too artificial but the double barrel resolute blows this away at resolute day this might have been the variant i preferred the least,0.5026280639420447,0.8199
6145,Darkstar November,wow having at a share right after i had damon from hill farmstead and i think i like this better very marshmallows mouthfeel pours so dark with a great head delicious,0.5026142584134553,0.9622
5571,Ghost In The Machine,hype machine was pretty dead on here slight knocks for feel could be creamier more lacing but all in all this one is great all citra neipas are some of the best,0.5026128997631164,0.9169
2569,The Rusty Nail,this is the number 2 ranked oatmeal stout on this site behind one of my favorite beers of all time founders breakfast stout and that ranking is more than well deserved  what works the most for me is aging it on cinnamon oatmeal stouts shouldnt have spice or heat i thought until i had this beer the cinnamon is premonitory on the scent in a strong way as it is the strongest characteristic on the nose and then i taste it and id swear its a cinnamon beer thats not a bad thing because wow i dont think ive ever had a beer that is this spice forward without overpowering everything else plenty of roasty malt and a strong bourbon presence but that spiciness makes this a unique experience  medium to big bodied feel which is surprising cause i expected this to be a big ass beer its not nor is it thick or sticky or oily its a kind of medium in all ways type of feel if that makes sense except it as boozy as hell which is another turn on for it  honestly this may be one of the best beers ive had in a while and i wish i could order more from tavour when you encounter a just about perfect beer you know it im not one of those guys who doesnt give perfect scores and maybe this isnt perfect maybe if i examine it more id lower it but with the impression ive gotten over the last two hours letting it develop im going with 5s across the board right now im glad i got into tavour just because of fremont access,0.5025588686938552,0.9437
4190,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,im not a bba guy but this beer mother of god this beer is fantastic perfect amount of bourbon the mouth feel is up there with triple shot as a chewy thick stout the only knock on this beer is the fact that i cant get more of it a and a must trade for,0.5025131418708418,0.9398
610,Bourbon County Brand Stout,its truly a great stout i remember when it used to be affordable despite the price per bottle of this brew its still definitely one that you should try if you havent sweet and viscous with a little bit of an anise flavor in the finish its a brew i wish i could get more of,0.5024412424174078,0.8915
2425,§ucaba,2018 vintage enjoyed in the end of 2020 dark brown with a one finger dark beige head quickly fading its a lot on the caramel with notes of chocolate vanilla hints of coconut and tobacco the taste follows and remains balanced at all during the session  ive been waiting to try this one for years now when i saw it avaibility on an european website i didnt hesitate twice glad i could try it and share it with some friends a great offering nothing in your face but very balanced and showing a great set of brewing and aging skills a very classy brew,0.5024347844798153,0.9513
5893,Vicinity,can from zombier in teku glass playing avernum 5 really strong frutality and bitterness with some milkshake ipa reminiscences good but didnt live up the hype as it is nothing that more accessible breweries cant do nor surpass,0.5024317954885301,0.4208
5538,Birth Of Tragedy,2011 version had a 4 oz pour at the brewery l close to black not much head but the thin line did stay around for a while s mildly spicy coffee oak t chocolate and coffee oak barrel and a little bit of booze to it but that seems to have settled to the background f super smooth and rich o so its 6 years old older than my 2 kids lol had to argue with the wife over how much she was allowed to drink ,0.5024258068380714,0.9306
85,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,another one i had for the first time in 2020 typically i dont care for beer that has chile peppers infused but this one hits the nail on the hand the perfect blend with cinnamon,0.5022882890357903,0.8603
791,Morning Wood,2018 vintage drank 4519  yuss haus mach iii  this was a total maple bomb with some nice chocolate undertones its not subtle and if you dont like maple you should avoid at all costsbut i found it enjoyable id have another,0.5022208652873774,-0.2705
264,Very Hazy,great compliment to the standard haze offering showcases an impressive amount of hops and sass youll forget its 86 has the signature tree house mouth feel definitely worth tracking this one down,0.5020698985608537,0.891
116,Heady Topper,drank from a 16 oz can dated 52121 golden opaque yellow with decent initial foam  poured partially into a glass to observe color very pleasant albeit strong and thick  good feel not sure i can really add to whats already been posted worthy of the hype,0.5020614632309822,0.9
1131,V.S.O.J.,this is the 2021 version i was lucky enough to grab a 4 pack so this is out of the can made this one last and it was almost like drinking two different beers at first it was very oaky with some vanilla and more boozy as it warmed up you could taste a little dark fruit and the vanilla became stronger it also didnt taste as sweet as it got warmer the whole drinking experience was an exercise in patience as i wanted to chug all 12 oz but im glad i took my time and savored this masterpiece revolution just keeps one upping themselves with every release and im totally hooked,0.5020317389209131,0.9479
5991,Coolship Red,2019 vintage drank 4519  yuss haus mach iii  i found this less subtle than the regular coolship which was a revelation for me fruit forward  enjoyable but a bit onenote  the base beer is a delicate beauty best enjoyed on its own this will do in a pinch though,0.5020263345183469,0.9623
2363,Trappistes Rochefort 10,this is a wonderful quad but the alcohol notes are a bit hot for me i typically prefer sub 10 beers and have enjoyed worse quads more because there are a bit cooler highly recommend for an experience but not a favorite,0.5019252336443855,0.4801
4208,La Fosse,had poured onsite at side project cellar from a 375ml bottle wow is it spectacular with a tart punch to the face that finishes smooth from the apricot very delightful mouth feel that makes this perfect for a summer day,0.5018793921352158,0.9227
3617,Lou Pepe - Gueuze,bottle at akkurat in stockholm i think this was a 2011 akkurat blend so perfectly balanced  not too sour and not too funky the lou pepe are really a step above the standard cantillon releases and that is really saying something,0.5018714914877481,0.7692
4194,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,holy cow had this on site today splitting the bottle with a few friends unbelevable so thick so rich you would never guess the high abv coffee could drink forever,0.501866296783717,0.842
3720,Double Stack,greeeeat notion love love love the pnw and gn this is one of their best beers and every year we get the double stack funny we got this in a four pack of cans on drop day because we cant sit and have it on tap soooo good on tap on the drive home with the four pack sitting on my back seat i looked at bren and asked can you smell maple of course she could she is from the east coast where maple syrup is like beer here in portland or before we opened the can we could smell the maple so for those that say they cant get maple drinking this thing idk what to tell you ok so we got it home and had our 12 year old daughter help us carry things inside and when she did she asked what maple did we get lol again the cans were weeping maple  look dark almost black  two finger width tan head with nice brown lacing down the glass as we drank smell on the nose you get day old coffee then some maple followed by some maple and ending with some maple taste sweet day old coffee followed by maple with hints of vanilla and roast feel full smooth with a small tickle of carbonation  ok so if you like coffee and maple pancakes this is your beer for a 11 abv stout the booze is hidden incredibly well and will creep up on you after a couple of these since bren loves maple everything this is her go to stout i like coffee and beer so its the best of both worlds lol  cheers everyone,0.5017728849669081,0.9957
2225,Triple Shot,another wonderful and worthy effort from tree house which is helping set standards for the style this one has it all and is worthy of the high scores nose balance flavor character and biglasting finish very bold and drinkable,0.5017556584806643,0.9273
4217,La Fosse,had at cbc 2016 i love sour beers and there were some great ones there this one was simply too much though everything that would probably make this beer great as well gets overshadowed by the extreme sourness without a doubt the most sour beer ive ever had as a bit of a novelty  definitely worth trying but man my teeth hated me after this one,0.5017549985076353,0.5114
1155,Maman,batches vary from year to year served on draft at the brewery for 2020 its chewy fishy barrel heavy and really enjoyable in small quantities my only complaint is that its served so cold off the draft line,0.5017175012148019,0.2484
4534,Impermanence,enjoyable to sip but there was too much of a singular maple and cola dominance in the flavor to put this beer in the topechelon for me with less maple this would be all time that being said the mouthfeelbody is really pleasant and the 9 is well hidden,0.501530012823941,0.8931
2039,Keene Idea,so freaking good not as good as bad boy but the dry hop on this beer is so amazing has that cloudy ipa look that i love and it so smooth and drinkable i wish i could have a tap of this straight from alpine in my house,0.5014263629699357,0.9579
5526,Juicy,pleasantly surprised on how much of a treat this was big thanks to vermonthiker this was not at all what i expected completely surprised me and the nose was really something to behold bottle date 2015 on this one need a fresh bottle to see what all this time did to it a lot of bread grapes grass wine and hop bitterness in both nose and taste the wine barrels seemingly diminish whatever profound tartness wants to come out and punch you in the jaw ill drink this again and again and again this is a beer id like to drink every weekday on warm summer nightsfor one must know how to make use of their stupidity as much as of their fire juicy,0.5013885249879375,0.7713
4239,Saison Bernice,i thought this beer was fantastic i did think that the overall acidity was a little more than what i wanted from a saison farmhouse ale but nonetheless very good cheers to tim and adair,0.501381098328988,0.9033
690,Very GGGreennn,look perfect ipa look light brownish yellow smellthis is where this is one of the best smells in beer tasteincredible luscious melon with a dry hopness that is very in your face compare to there other green variants feelsuper slick with a very soupy head these guys are the kings of that very similar to many of there beers and that is a good thing overallthere are others i like more from th but what the hell does that mean when you are drinking tree housealways exceptional to many others,0.5013352564582684,-0.1901
4068,KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,this is another of founders recent releases that is worth the price  this beer makes me marvel at the combination of taste feel and smell  it pours perfectly it smells heavenly and the taste is awesome from first touch to the lips to the swallow and retrohale,0.5012837972284396,0.9517
4518,BDCS,2017 version poured from a 12 oz can at home thanks for the trade jon bourbon and chocolate like a bourbon soaked brownie exceeded my expectations,0.5012529900576461,0.6597
707,KBS,chocolate coffee and bourbon all in one the smoothness and ease with which it goes down is detrimental to your mental health with the 12 abv i am an ipa fanatic but this one beats any ipa i have tried hands down thank you brewniverse in shreveport la for carrying this,0.5011468348898809,0.6124
5092,Barrel Aged Bomb!,interested and curious to try this again because i remember the first time having this in 2016 noting that it muted the chili peppers and now with the 2017 and 2018 bomb i have felt like the pepper quality has already been muted and because its only 112 the regular is 13 and pirate bomb is 15 whats the difference here lets see pouring from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass this beer pours out looking like dark chocolate in color and forms a very thin caramel crown that disippated before i even got a picture the first thing i notice on the smell is a ton of dark fruit raisins and plums dance around while introducing you to some barrel notes in the form of a dry oak smell very good smell but im not getting too much from the nose in the way of the regular bomb so well see what the tastes brings from the first sip the chocolate kicks through the curtain and steals the floor while the dark fruit are supporting from behind as far as the chili peppers its about what i expected you wouldnt even know theyre in the beer i wish the coffee and vanilla were showing up a little more as well but i do have to say that this is greatly balanced as far as the whiskey and barrel being present but not overpowering the mouthfeel is thick and fudge like it coats the mouth all the way through while providing a slight and well balanced warming sensation overall this was a very good treat and im glad to have another crack at it but its pretty much what i remember from the first time its very good but not great ive had better barrel aged beers and it does bother me that this one covers up all the flavors of the original kinda takes the point away to me i guess its a solid treat nonetheless but give me a regular bomb and ill be good,0.5011424578282105,0.9879
20,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,reviewing 2019 vintage this pours thick and close to black with unsurprisingly poor head retention that being said i drank this out of a taster glass does not stop the nose from jumping out of the glass huge coffee and maple as advertised masking any potential aroma from the barrel that trend continues into the taste  difficult to find the barrel even when looking intently for it the coffee is very pleasant and plays well with the maple which presents authentically and not as a general sweetness thick smooth mouthfeel again no surprises here overall this would receiving a rating bump if it wasnt meant to be a barrel aged beer in that respect it falls short as the adjuncts and texture are the real star of the show here very cool to try but not worth the price of admission these days,0.5011421468357924,0.6583
5933,Peche 'n Brett,500ml169oz bottle purchased at nectar in kendall yards spokane washington for 1790 batch no 2019 bottle date 032019 wa now 85 abv btw  abbreviated review  last time i had a beer from logsdon they were being brewed by a different brewer for a different owner in a different state whats different not much still a great beer want some fruit and funk look no further,0.5011233646109385,0.25
3183,Great,big thick and dark theres a joke in there somewhere are the only ways to describe this epic barleywine from alpine while overall i found it to be a touch too sweet its still a fantastic ba version of the style,0.5010469261868056,0.8316
2316,Breakfast Stout,i bought this one on a whim i love stoats especially spiced coffee and chocolate one so i figured id give this one a try i was so pleasantly surprised this is truly one of the best beers ive ever had and it has a decent alcohol content as well i like it when a single beer is enough to relax me this one tastes like dessert definitely try it,0.5010239158267449,0.9821
390,Assassin,i became a big toppling goliath fan over the past few years and traveled out to the brewery in august 2019 assassin was on tap and it was the best beer in the joint my draft was a beautiful midnight black with light lacing thick and bold with rich mouthfeel slightly boozy aroma chocolate notes blend magnificently with coffee on the back end there were a lot of excellent beers to try but i did several assassins and made a stop back on my way out of town the next day for another one this brew was deadly good give decorah iowa a try its a great small town  filthy dirty in a good way with norse culture and a few great breweries how can you go wrong,0.5009134721487302,0.9721
5883,Vicinity,as a huge trillium fan the vicinity sticks out of the pack as my favorite trillium to date creamy creamy head smooth buttery aftertaste i refer to this as the nectar of the gods in the beer world if i could only have 1 beer for the rest of my life this is the one,0.5008243131304877,0.765
5147,Clare's Thirsty Ale,glad i tracked down a growler of this this turned out to be as good as everybody says hard to get they need to bottle this beautiful rick chocolate and raspberry ba stout,0.5008198081138113,0.8962
5278,Dorothy (Wine Barrel Aged),this has a wonderful bursting lemon mixed with pith that makes this complex sophisticated and easy drinking a major upgrade from regular dorothy great offering almost in the realm of art ann and le sarrasin,0.5007616345909507,0.936
4766,Last Snow,a porter called  last snow from a florida brewery funky buddha had to be interesting but i never expected it to be exceptional revealing beautiful flashes of ruby and garnet when held up to a backlight and a bouquet that is redolent of coffee chocolate and coconut its no surprise that one person declared it to be like a liquefied mounds bar and that analogy remains relevant on the palate a smooth mouthfeel and a sweetish finish produce a wonderfully crafted beer some have criticized the sweetness level but i didnt find it to be excessive its a truly great dessert beer and one thats on a par with another favorite of mine called samoa this and as it warms it gets even more flavorful making it a great choice for any snow birds in the northeast who want to sip it in front of a roaring fire that said last snow is definitely not a session beer one and done at one sitting would be my recommendation but if youre a fan of those flavors youd be wise to keep a sixer on handespecially if you run out out mounds bars,0.5005395941684926,0.9938
615,Bourbon County Brand Stout,this one is unique and a special experience i took my time and with each sip got lost in a medley of vanilla roasted coffee chocolate caramel charred wood and bourbon my only regret was that i was tasting this one solo and not sharing the experience with a friend will have to save a few bottles and share post covidor maybe not ,0.5003891525389533,0.5951
156,Mornin' Delight,maybe its the psychology of how hard this is to come by or how expensive it is but i loved this one the only points i took off were for how sticky it leaves everything and for lack of a head the taste is fantastic  none of the bitterness of a typical beer of its kind all of the flavour  if you arent into sweet beers this wont be your jam it takes what founders maple mackinac fudge does and removes the boozy sting it tastes like french press coffee those little maple syrup sugar candies and a bit of chocolate it keeps the chocolate smooth and without the harshbitter pure cocoa notes many stouts these days have  the colour is black with a slight tan head which dissipates quickly the beer is syrupy and will leave the glass your lips and anything you touch sticky like resin probably the price to pay for such a delightfully sweet beer  i had this on draft at rogue island in providence at 16 for a 12 oz pour its much better than paying 50 for a bottle not sure if i would do that despite how good the beer is i can see why its in the top 10 but it seems like mostmany of the beers in the top 10 are limited releases with improbable obtainability so maybe psychology and hype brings them to the top of the list i wish there were more smoothless harsh breakfast stouts like this funky buddah had a good one a year ago if they came out with a version that added a bacon note id probably drive to the brewery to get it,0.5003597761740014,0.9903
546,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,great beer but i have to say for the value and what i gave up to get this i would rather go for the non ba version great beer where i think the bourbon barrel actually does not add a lot cause there are so many adjuncts definitely a chocolate bomb gets points because of angry chairs dark lacing and overall turbid oily thickness that makes it a unique beer,0.5002558389247799,0.7576
4713,Crusher,yeah this was old but like so many cans in my stash i have no idea when this was brewed as there wasnt anything written on the bottom of it this was a musthave because of its rating on here and even though this was old this was such a hop bomb that i had to take my time sipping this yes this beer was quite intense but it was worth the effort to enjoy as the label was quite indicative of what the liquid was like  hazy amber and not topped off with a lot of head there was lots of debris floating in this but surprisingly the lacing left behind wasnt that thick at all hop oils tropical fruits weed and nectar filled the nose as they could all be found in the taste as well lychee passion fruit star fruit jack fruit and orange blossom filled the palate as the taste was quite complex and rich while being dry at the same time hoppy herbal and underlying sweet this had a subtle but longlasting stickiness that was indicative of this beers makeup as it was hard to put away while being hard to resist at the same time  plenty of booze here but it was felt more than tasted although i could feel it creeping up on my well before i finished this off a deep fresh dank pine tied everything in together as it was felt from the first sip until well after the last drop went down if you like your beers to be complex and engrossing at the same time youve found youre match here this was a solid brew that deserves its lofty rating on here even though i wasnt quite gungho about it as others on here have been its easy to see why this is so loved as its a musthave for anyone looking for the best of what a new england ipa has to offer just make the time to savor this properly,0.5002541925523464,0.9956
1879,Haze,every th beer seems to blend into each other thats what happens when the same yeast is in every beer that being said that means every product is solid hazehas a distinction really good hazy style but has a slight wc finish and bite my favorite ipa i have ever had,0.5002365893823624,0.7504
4188,Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,hands down the best stout ive ever had might be a bit biased because i had it while at hf and in a perfect scenery but the mouthfeel is unbelievable as silky as can be plus the nose just bursts with coffee notes glad i was able to get this vintage bottle on site,0.5000424588467702,0.8735
2062,Black Note Stout,finally found this beer in a bottle at a grocery store in nyc on 75th and 2nd i think its good but not as unbelievable as some of the ratings indicate the malt taste is solid and definitely worth drinking but ive tasted better amongst newer releases prison double barrel wham whams other half 5th etc,0.49996088508129416,0.7401
3724,Double Stack,i had no idea when i traded for this how highly rated it was on here sure its an american imperial stout with all the booze and heft that one would expect but this was so tasty and wonderful that i didnt even notice how strong it was until i looked at the label yeah this was a beast but it wasnt just because of the booze as this had enough behind it to back up its overt heft of course i thought that was a wonderful thing  of course this had a dark brown pour to it with a thin mocha head that didnt last long the lacing left behind was thin and scattered as much of the soapy bubbles slid down the side of my pint glass after every sip tons of maple syrup molasses and rich coffee in the slightly muted nose but good lord everything was amplified a few notches once i took a sip of this really really impressed with how this felt as the thickness sugary sweetness and roasted notes came through in the taste lipsmackingly wonderful as even my hand smelled like fresh maple syrup once i put my glass down if my breakfast at ihop could be fermented and made to last for the duration this would be the end result as i could almost taste the syrups that i pour on my pancakes as i worked my way through this  sure this was strong and it felt every bit of the 11 abv that it was from the first sip down to the last one when you have a beer that feels like pancake batter berry compote and fresh roasted joe all rolled into one you dont forget it soon and that was the case with this offering from great notion slightly roasted reminiscent of sarsaparilla and slick like something fresh brewed this beer was truly one of a kind dated112618 near the top of the can with drink now above that i let this go for a bit but it held up well over the last year and change easily worth its accolades and ratings on here i loved this beer and am so glad that i was able to get a can of it to review,0.49968753409099004,0.9989
466,Julius,the original is still one of the best treehouse has to offer the balance between hops and juiciness is top rate will always be my favorite treehouse beer,0.4996821720533162,0.8834
30,Marshmallow Handjee,2019 handjee poured from cellar temp into a plastic glass shared with friends spread out in my backyard  the base beer is big and fudgy decent amount of oakbarrel to reign it in getting a touch of soy sauce like oxidation though which distracts from what i think this beer is going for,0.4996295789715696,0.6908
4372,Cutting Tiles - Galaxy,one of the best ipas ive had would put this just below perm 32 for me i remember having mosaic cutting tiles last year and thought it was a mess the new fermentation for these beers not only makes the hop flavors pop but also smooths them out and they look great in the glass really this is possibly the best looking ipa ive had its looks like a puree of pineapples and oranges and has a thick sticky head the taste is like 32 but a little more bite that i really liked theyre knocking these beers out of the park lately,0.49953916991021374,0.9769
6202,Second Fiddle,apparently i have never reviewed second fiddle thats weird to me because i first had it probably seven years ago when i first visited fiddlehead and they had tapped it just before i had arrived of course it was fantastic then living up to my expectations in every possible way but every time ive had it since then i must say ive been kinda let down this batch however is from 51421 and is definitely the highestquality canned batch ive had it easily eclipses every prior sf iteration ive consumed and thus i believe it is a fitting entry for a review  the pour is honestly way clearer than i remember i dont think sf has ever been a super hazy beer but this is like 90 clear building up a decent head of bonewhite foam with a chunkiness that stands in rather stark contrast to the clear golden beer below it leaves behind a fantastic and consistent trail of lace around the entire glass and the legs themselves are pretty nice as well body is like a light orangecaramel color with plenty of suspended solids if held up to direct light meaning its definitely been centrifuged still not completely clear but not quite hazydoughy neipa realm stuff either this looks just great  the nose has this insane deep pinecone like scent that just smacks of oldschool ipa but also contains lots of fun fruity esters as well mango and tangerine with hints of guava combine with west coast pine and grapefruit funkiness it just jives super well this is definitely the best and most cohesive batch of this beer that i have personally had since they started canning it its bringing me back totally to the first time i tried it lemony notes and subtle tropical fruit elements coming out as it warms so glad i got another can noticed the different artdesign for the can and wondered if maybe it brought with it a change in recipe or some kind of refinement not 100 sure but feels that way to me so far  flavor is super clean pine with biscuity malt bringing up the backend bolstered by superb undertones of mango guava and passion fruit alongside some hints of tangerinetangelo and herbal grassiness man this is drinking so great right now im sure it being 11 days old has more than a little to do with it but i am reimpressed by this brew had a few meh experiences with it over the years since but this is giving me the feeling that they know exactly what theyre doing and what may be necessary to bring this brew into the modern realm love that it doesnt seem like they gave in to trends and made it a hazy dipa its just a superbly crafted piney citrusy slightlytropical ipa from new england trends be damned hoping to keep tracking this one down over time to see that they keep the quality intact,0.49945761031680497,0.999
4206,La Fosse,i had this right after having fuzzy at the tasting room in st louis and they are neck and neck i may actually prefer la fosse because the apricots have a more unique aroma and tartness that set it apart from fuzzy more significantly than anticipated,0.49912502469295855,0.0
5745,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),solid stout here nice head and lace the base beer is good enough i dont get a great deal of smooth barrel here has a little bite after taste is so so i had another version a while ago that was much better cant remember the wax color,0.4990979791475652,0.7654
2621,Last Buffalo In The Park,drank 032420 out of a tulip bottle dated 2016 or 2017 properly cellared  hate to say i was slightly underwhelmed a nice looking beer with a nice feel not at think as ive come to expect from fb but still good did get a nice coconut smell and taste but think the time on the bottle probably muted both of those a bit the thing i didnt like as much was the roasty taste which i guess might be the porter part but could also be some darker coffee roasts and no hint of alcohol or barrel at all  this would have help for me so be it my opinion id like to try a fresher bottle but given the cost probably only if im gifted it some dayfat chance at that cheers,0.4990650521761,0.9505
888,Parabola,im not sure it lives up to the hype even though its a great beer it has nearly a solid black body with light brown foam although it doesnt have much of head smell contains a lot of the bourbonvanilla flavor one would expect taste delivers as well with a nice cherry body in the middle very light carbonation and feels pretty light for what it is which im not sure is exactly ideal overall id highly recommend for the flavor but i dont know if it merits the 100 it currently has,0.49893788875276196,0.9019
3721,Double Stack,on draft at georgetown taproom some time ago this beer really left an impression it was cold and raining when it was served to me after about 15 seconds of it being on the table outside i could smell it clear as day even through my mask tons of maple and coffee absolutely divine the taste was just as good roasted coffee and a bucketload of maple yet so well balanced the foam laced the sides of the glass as i drank it damn near perfect,0.4986276340285321,0.936
1356,Rare Scooop,this is one of those beers i wish i had more of waiting in line at 3 am and only getting one was rough but worth it no trading this one for me the flavors were all there from a typical neapolitan chocolate vanilla and strawberry the strawberry being the most dominant coming through giving it a super sweet flavor excellent combo if you ask me would love to see this collaboration happen again cycle and 3 sons are putting out phenomenal beers,0.49860113517805926,0.9792
3892,Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Star: Coffee Edition,2017 bottle drank out of a tulip on 040420  poured thick and dark with a nice cream colored half inch head some of which lingered around the edges of the glass for the remainder of the pour i couldnt get much aroma but its just not a strong suit of mine  im sure it was there taste was dominated by strong dark coffee as it warmed the barrel notes really came out and i really enjoyed it the sweetness was nuanced and perhaps hidden in the bitterness such that it wasnt so much in your face as you typically get in so many of todays pastry stouts so this was a nice change i didnt get much of the typical oatmeal stout flavors but that also might have been masked in the roadty coffee notes and the barrel taste as i write my review i realize this is quite a complex beer but for me it was rather two note  dark coffee and bourbon barrel if thats what you want  this will hit the spot  and it hit the spot for me last night if you can get the rest of the beauty good on you theres a lot here and ive got a 2016 bottle aging as well cheers,0.49849674720398035,0.9892
1228,Vanilla Bean Assassin,tasted this in a flight at the brewery on jan 7th 2021first time ever tasting assassin drove 4 hours because this was on tap i had half a pour in the afternoon at 5 last of it as the keg blew it is a fudge vanilla cake like flavor the depth of the flavor was incredible i arrived at 1130 and took tell two to finish the flight as this warmed and oxidized the aroma subsided as expected but the flavor just developed more chocolate cake outstanding and worth the trip to finally taste this i had morning delight and term oil maple cakes in the same flight plus the two lattes best flight of my life truly wonderful beer,0.498180304036895,0.9869
5609,Space Trace,space trace is one of two beers procured by friends who wanted to help me out after my dark lord bottles were stolen i dont know how they made this happen  something about new glarus strawberry rhubarb bottles  but i love bottle logic and i was ecstatic to have the opportunity to try space trace  i was really startled by how barrelforward space trace is im a bit accustomed at this point to how vanilla forward many of their beers tend to be  but space trace smacks you in the face right away with a strong barrel nose and taste its follow by lots of chocolate and coconut with very pleasant bourbon notes its a thick rich beer which is a very nice change from thin coconut beers typically rum barrelaged  while i really love space trace its one that doesnt drink itself  its delicious but its an active drinker  it requires attention and appreciation i could only drink just a bit of it  certainly not a whole bottle  at a sitting then again its summer  so it may just be a seasonal thing feed me a bottle when the temperature dips below freezing and you may hear a very different review,0.49817941095846513,0.9957
943,Fuzzy,truly one of the best sours out there hard to get your hands on but worth the price unfortunately when you get a pour or bottle it does not last long i had this at side project bar in early 2017 visiting a friend in st louis i believe it was the second batch good haze with a bright orange had a sweet complexity of peaches that developed into everlasting funky earthy acidity that beckoned another sip must try if you are a sour lover,0.49796707316769184,0.9756
2090,Flora Plum,this is head and shoulders above the other flora variants and among hfs best saisons had both batches at a recent tasting both are excellent but batch 1 had a flavor that had burned in and integrated and a bit more funk that put it over the top seek out,0.4976914462663749,0.7311
1905,Chocolate Rain,carbonation was a bit low with pour head retention not what i have seen with the other black tuesday varients otherwise this is basically black tuesday with the chocolate notes turned up to 11 which is not a bad thing,0.4975624339110711,0.1901
5963,Smooth,damn this is ridiculously good it was bursting with stone fruit and the as usual the carb was perfect i will say after having it side by side with fuzzy that the stone fruit doesnt pop like the peaches in fuzzy but still amazing,0.49751165699615935,0.7503
394,Assassin,2014 vintagemay 26th 2019this is amazing every sip is a different experience flavors all over the place maple vanilla chocolate not nearly the viscosity of sr71 but leagues ahead of all around worth trying,0.4974941189312499,0.5789
3401,Hommage,bottled 102418 consumed 41120  the mouthfeel has more carbonation than the appearance would suggest it could use more bubbles when i look at it but the mouthfeel is perfect i recognize it as a 3 fonteinen instantly when i smell it and taste it it is pretty tart but not too much for me i could just smell this all day long its wonderful very complex on the pallet its the perfect beer to sip and savor outside on a warm day or while watching a movie on a sat night while social distancing from the world im so happy i found this and have another bottle in the cellar im curious if the tartness will tamp down with age or how it will change one of my favs from belgium for sure,0.4971962295518262,0.9893
5689,Hop JuJu,had it at the fat heads in pittsburgh met up with a cousin and his wife that i havent seen in 20 years had a great time  started the evening with this beer was happy to see it on the tap list  served in a snifter clear golden yellow color with excellent head and lacing pine smell and taste strong citrus and vanilla classic imperial ipa happy to get it on tap  had a wonderful time at the tap house,0.4969974166128941,0.9771

4833,Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,ive had better offerings from other half this is sortof a simple sweetbase one dimensional  albeit tasty  beer i get that its a ddh all citra juice bomb and thats cool i like it fine just that a beer with these kind of reviews i expected more maybe the reviews are precraftbeer revolution cuz if i had this beer 5 years ago i would have been dumbfounded,0.49684534442740186,0.4019

1349,Rare Scooop,just a perfect beer the mix of flavors is incredible imagine the ideal cross scoop out of a pint of neapolitan ice cream with the barrel to balance the strawberry goodness do yourself a favor and get your hands on one of these,0.4967689085445315,0.9282
3078,Parabajava,parabajava 2016 has quite sadly fallen off very badly friends and i opened a 2016 side by side with a parabola 2018 and surprisingly the parabola was the superior of the two the parabajava had very little coffee left to brag of unfortunately  mostly just a lingering acidic taste with a strange umami and vegetal taste i was tremendously disappointed after having traded for this bottle  im still a very big fan of firestone walker beers and do not blame them for a moment some beers age well and others do not i surely hope that we see a fresh release of this beer some time in the near future for a more favorable review fingers crossed,0.49675273421818766,-0.0474
5088,Barrel Aged Bomb!,this is simply a fantastic ba stout bomb is super wellbalanced but the barrel aging process seemed to really bring out the vanilla in the vintage we tried which can be a bad thing if its not good vanilla but this seemed like high quality stuff wish i had more,0.49673736941452085,0.2361
536,Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,those of you that actually read past the fact sheet on my reviews know that i carry a strong inherent bias against pastry stouts because i dont handle sweetness very well some of you may have also noticed that i dont seem as disenchanted when it comes to barrelaged stouts and barleywine when they sometimes taste as sweet if not sweeter than other representations of pastry stouts available on the market  besides the actually unendurable levels of sweetness that set light up my tas1r2 and tas1r3 with the force of hellfire the thing that puts me off most about pastry stouts seem to be the driving force behind its popularity im not going to straight up say that i dont like pastry stouts because of all the hype and attention they receive because i myself am guilty of buying into beers and brands that receive hype and attention and actually enjoying them every once in a while but its probably because one of the things i value most about beer is that its proletariat and ubiquitous in nature if i like a beer i want to be able to reach out into my fridge and grab another one or run to the store and buy another without feeling like i could have done better things with my moneythe reason why i value mouthfeel so much in a beer is because i personally believe that correlates most strongly into how repeatable a beer is no matter how flavorful or unique tasting a brew should be i normally wont want to try another unless theres some sense of balance or leveling factor that clears my palate for the next sip  given my totally madeup standards and personal values stated above pastry stouts couldnt stand any further from brews that i would normally be willing to pay an amount of money or stand in line for im pretty sure this comment will come back to bite me in the ass when i find myself standing in line for ba double stack next month but i digress  some actual preliminary thoughts about this beer apparently german chocolate cake doesnt really come from germany and despite its name its main highlight is whipped cream and the coconutpecan frosting thats used to fill the cake on a more relevant note this beer is best summed up by contrasting it to the beloved street fighter zero character hibiki dan  so for those of you that arent millennials or were living under a rock when street fighter dans character was created as a parody of snks king of fighters franchise characters ryo and robert who very suspiciously resembled street fighters two most recognizable characters ryu and ken outside of having twisted mannerisms and catchphrases suspiciously resembling the two snk characters that were ripping off capcom characters that he was ripping off dan is kind of memorable for being all show and no power whatsoever his superex combo finish shinkū gadōken for example looks awfully similar to ryūs shinkū hadōken while doing 140th of the damage it doesmanyatimes have i sat in front of the tv screen thinking oh shit im fucked when i saw the screen suddenly turn red orange and yellow while cpu dan caught me off guard with my hp at 30 only to realize my character was still alive after being hit by ostentatious super combo  labored metaphors aside baigcc is similar to dans super finish in that it packs all the flavors it purports to deliver in one ginormous sugarspiceandeverythingnice upside your head but then presenting a rapidly drying finish which makes you feel stupid for cringing and bracing for impactits hard to explain in close detail but its like the opposite of getting a penicillin shot at the doctors where you dont feel the needle going in but it feels like somebody injected the meaty part of your butt cheek with peanut butter for the rest of the day  a vacuum wave motion fist of toasted coconuts wild sugar cane rum cake bakers chocolate intense caramelized sugar hits you square in the noggin followed by a frostinglike sweetness theres a slight hint of hazelnuts that follow the gargantuan sweet super attack before all the flavors just simply drop off the side of the earth save for some residual flavors of hazelnuts and powdered sugar your pixelated character brushes off the blow as if nothing happened and gets up ready to fight againthe fight against the glass is one of attrition after that initial surprise  the mouthfeel is initially thick and sticky like raw cake batter but it morphs into a more tolerable moistish soft texture with subsequent sips the only way carbonation could make any impact on this beer is if it were effervescent to the level of a brut champagne the intense brick wall of mouthfeel counteracts against any fleeting semblance of carbon dioxide on the tongue,0.4964634350773702,0.9925
1644,Black Tuesday,i tried 2017 and 2020 versions of this beer both pretty amazing beers this rating is for the 2020 version which i thought was a bit more crisp and diverse in its taste,0.49629133010678295,0.7906
1041,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,slightly overrated imo this stout is on the high end of the cinnamon war so if thats your thing  you must try it no too sweet ill give it that otherwise ive found many more balanced brews in the category such as coffee cinnamon bourbon abominable by fremont hunahpu is worthy of a try and of forming your own opinion but you may also not find it up to the hype,0.4962171513305648,-0.511
4136,Oude Geuze Golden Blend,2014 vintage drank 62219  golgi apparatus  a delightful fruity balanced geueze that showcases the brewers art to the nth degree had this in a share with a lot of heavy hitters and it was my favorite cant wait to have another,0.49621116960768047,0.8402

5997,Coolship Red,definitely a solid offering but frankly i had higher expectations i much prefer other allagash similar offerings like bizou only at the brewery and nancy either way a solid beer,0.49604705603990157,0.743
1105,Atrial Rubicite,looks gorgeous in color and smell i saved this for xmas night so my expectations were high and theyve been met lots of raspberries on the tongue more so than any belgian lambics that ive had not that ive had all that many its tart but not overwhelmingly so more so than someone who doesnt know sours or lambics would normally like though i feel like its missing the special bite of my favorite 3 fonteinen lambics but i dont know what makes that flavor pop in my mouth this is still world class and ill be seeking out more,0.4958981166544527,0.8751
4917,Barrel-Aged Silhouette,ok so i recently picked up some of these down here in milwaukee never had it before was on my want list for several years now  poured a dark near black smells heavily barrel forward and not cheap barrel at that tastes like the nose barrel forward with the beer itself complimenting the notes of the barrel barrel lingers in the mouth for a bit then fades to the base beer  if you want a ba stout that isnt barrel dominant this isnt for you interestingly though i usually fall in that camp and i absolutely love this beer and am hoarding all i can find of it,0.4958064053202754,0.9106
4177,Art,wow what a funky noseapple meets barnyard funkiness however the flavor is a little more restrained and not quite up to the nose a seriously delicious ba saison but i have to agree with another reviewer its no le sarrasin next up is ann so ill have to see how it matches up life is rough,0.4956421316574187,-0.3126

4309,Bad Boy,this is a beer i have been hearing about and reading about for what seems like forever so it was awesome to finally get to try it one of those beers of lore always wondered how much better than everything else can something like this really be and the answer is that it probably was considerably better than whatever anyone else was doing with this style when it was first introduced more than a decade ago now it kind of just seems like another one thats not a knock against it of course it was clearly a pioneering beer and more of a trend setter than these guys probably could have imagined less clear than what was popular at the time but certainly not hazy for the sake of it although this could be credited at least partially with making room for such things i love the hop complexion i get the columbus way ahead of the galaxy its so hoppy that i can almost taste the pellets the greenness the vegetal element not just the compounds we desire in the beer its juicy and its kind of sweet from the pale barley malt too but there is a lot of orange juice grapefruit zest and pine needle character here very northwestern to me slick and oily feeling and dense as can be almost woody like lumber and with a lot of body too its a big one for sure perfectly appropriately named the bitterness is all after the swallow which is cool its a long trajectory of flavors citrus abounds as well later on a honey taste and richness in the middle and very good although possibly not as well refined and distinctive as i thought it would be after all the hype over the years i think like pliny or something that the rest of the field has caught up enough where this isnt as mindblowingly unique as it probably once was but that does not diminish its excellence,0.4953735867317089,0.9946
1635,Focal Banger,canned 2112021 consumed mostly straight from the can as suggested but i poured a sample into a glass to have a look and to get a good whiff looks like an ipa should on the pour pale gold body white head the scent is incredible from the glass the freshness is evident flavors are more concentrated when right out of the can they are lighter and perhaps lifted when in the glass plenty of grapefruit flavor to be found i was surprised and happy to find this in a local place the four pack cost me about twenty five dollars and im not angry about it,0.4953258351189358,0.9612
283,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),a somewhat classic from founders this big brother of kbs its a lot more a lot and that tells you something ass kbs itself is also a good beer still it doesnt come close to this lots of coffee choco wnice mouthfeel to it,0.4952115321862337,-0.1531
3039,Grey Monday,in the interest of fairness i am not a huge fan of hazelnut there is something of putting about the overall profile that said at the front the thick boozing this is very apparent lingering about the mouth the hazelnut was very easy to detect the field was very sticky and sweet swinging easily to the sides of the mouth the feel was almost chewy raisins and dark fruit were also present yet in the overall scheme of things the hazelnut make this hard for me to like,0.4949904388066505,0.873
2737,Blåbær Lambik,the blueberry taste was a little more subdued than i expected but despite that its still a fantastic beer goes without saying that it feels pretty cool to notch this one off my bucket list  it helps to have friends who are connected,0.4948396796615997,0.967

1167,Maman,enjoyed side by side at a share with beer barrel time my expectations were sort of turned on their head as bbt was the clear loser between the two and for some reason id expected maman to spiced in some way not so  maman features a very nice prominent display of barrels its also very sweet and had a pleasant rich nose and mouthfeel its a delicious beer but one that doesnt lend itself well to casual drinking that should probably be obvious  but by the time i was done with maman my pallet was a bit wrecked and ready to move on to something a little less intense  its still wellbalanced and delicious  but its an intense experience dont sleep on maman it was my second favorite of the evening in a big big whale share but dont expect the world of it either,0.4947522218979437,0.9787

4397,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,i had the original by the tulsa boys i thought and still think its the best beer i ever had this new one is a let down first smell was that apple juice dominated over everything else that was odd and off putting compared to the original first taste was rewarding that it seemed balanced like the original then the big let down came into play the mouth drenching aftertaste of apple juice plagued my mouth this is not a barreled apple brandy if it is it is way over powering of the bomb like base that seems balanced at first the actual brandy alcohol seems even lost to me from the apple domination is this a bad beer no is this the best beer i ever had  no i even doubt the 12 abv and would rate lower around 10 i took no measurements though its just not as rich and balanced as the original plain and simple considering this is my favorite beer ever please try again i will applaud the extra effort,0.4926548488816551,0.9669

737,Duck Duck Gooze,when i took my first and only trip to great american beer fest in 2017 i didnt know a lot about the lost abbey  id heard a few things about veritas and id tried a select few of their beers i was a fan but i didnt pursue their beer to the degree that i do now i knew that duck duck gooze was on the top 250 on beer advocate  but i never expected that id be able to try it  well now i recently made a facebook friend who used to live in san diego but now lives and brews in northern minnesota happy coincidence he happens to love sours just like i do he helped me out with a bottle of duck duck gooze among other things in our very first trade i was thrilled and still am  the beer is fantastic  its interesting to me how ddg differs from belgian gueuze though  the characteristic funk seems to be entirely absent and the nose doesnt pop to quite the same degree it smells very nice but its a different sort of aroma  and taste theres a bit of cheese to the taste and a very light clean crisp sort of sour and tart character again the belgian funk is missing perhaps this has been lost with time but it surprises me as older belgian lambic still seems to retain that funk theres also a marked lack of suspension  theres no noteworthy presence of fruit yeast or foreign matter of any kind i dont mind that i know some really enjoy that in belgian lambic but its a happy absence as far as im concerned  id have to say that ddg characterizes all of the things that i love about gueuze while it also happens to have bypassed the aspects that i am not such a big fan of its a terrific beer and really demonstrates why lost abbey is such a hyped and touted brewery i think that i will always try far harder to pick up bottles of russian river sours because theyre just a lot more accesible  but i will never pass on the chance to try another bottle of lost abbey their sours wilds and lambics are tremendous and ddg is one of their best,0.4921570437194049,0.9972

3450,Hypermash Hydra,this was a complete shocker to me its been the first bottle logic beer ive traded back the thickness is really a turning point i think bl will continue with no other bl beers to this date have produced this for the longest time in ca after trading for east coast beers i wondered why west coast stouts were so much thinner and finally i found something that reminded me of the answers cinammon papa boi but bourbon barrel aged beyond the thickness ill admit i have 2 bottles and the first had more cinammon than the second albeit not overwhelming it being siagon and not straight cassia bark perhaps made it more exotic the coffee profile was unreal just so decadent overall a real shocker didnt know bl could do this,0.49193125340336386,-0.8382

1178,Double Galaxy,canned 91520 consumed 101820  as with all the best nedipas this is a beautiful beer if it didnt taste and smell so amazing id wonder if they made beers just to look pretty on instagram but this matches on the other notes i love that the ones from the northeast do have a bit more of a bitter dry finish than the midwestern ones that i drink most often being from chicago i do wish theyd change to a 16oz can theres a reason why thats so popular now as a format size and with the dryer finish i could really drink more than 12oz in a sitting theres not as much on the nose as the super fresh hop butchers that i most often drink but that might be due to the can being a month old i still get nice hops and bitter grapefruit rind on the nose and pallet its a wonderfully balanced beer will hf ever expand and increase distribution if so people will undoubtedly say their quality has dropped even if it doesnt id love to see this in my area dont ever pass this one up,0.49158536228901334,0.9884

134,Pliny The Younger,im not the biggest fan of ipas but living nearish to the russian river brewery and experiencing the hype every year i just had to go to their location in windsor with a couple friends to try this back in february gotta love prepandemic times got it ontap while there as well as in bottled form for later color was slightly cloudy but mostly clear and it poured a very small head  ive had pliny the elder so i expected something along those lines but it was much stronger and bolder than that very prominent hop taste and smell as expected but it wasnt especially bitter for such a hoppy beer and the main notes i got were pine and citrus it was incredibly crisp and the flavor is very strong  each sip is meant to be savored so you definitely wont just go through a pint of this  i wasnt sure what to expect since i dont love ipas but i definitely could appreciate this one sure enough the ipaloving friend i was with absolutely adored it while the other who doesnt really drink ipas didnt especially like it i get why the hype around it exists and if you have a chance its worth it,0.4908140800548149,0.9945

2783,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,it tastes like beer mixed with copious amounts of honey a friend of mine drove all the way to boston snagged a bunch of trillium beer brought them back to ct and a sampling we did do i wish cutting tiles wasnt the first one i tried it reminded me of drinking dundees honey brown lager back in high school i was tempted to accidentally spill my glass off his deck to avoid further punishment but there were kids underneath playing laser tag and i was afraid of spilling it on them imagine having to rescue them from a bee attack or a bear attack if they were laced in cutting tiles i thoroughly enjoyed the other varieties but the 45 point world class reviews for this beer are completely misleading i think the beer is just riding the coattails of trilliums other quality recipes i desperately want to blind taste test some users on this site this beer is terrible save yourself the drive buy a double mosaic ipa that somehow tastes like a pilsner and stir in about a half a cup of honey and there you go cutting tiles also if you like tea and honey try tea and cutting tiles oh and i heard theyre partnering with general mills to make cutting tiles nut cheerios honey booboo is changing her name to cutting tiles booboo,0.4905970982367028,-0.743

5360,Rodenbach Caractère Rouge,this style requires a lot of work for me to like but caractere rouge i like note that only 2 of the 12 that ive had among the top 100 flanders reds did i rate above eachs ba average as a malthead tart is ok in the hands of a master the style is better in the hands of the masters of the masters that produce the styles finest i have to agree with the high accolades awarded caractere rouge  weakening my resistances to tart caractere uses more than cherries for its 6 month sit in fruit i detect raspberries thus caractere is more of a fruit cocktail that how other brewers merely use malt to impart fun and bacteria to impart natures art and barrels to impart complex flavors  if i were a sourphile id put rodenbach on my bbbl list belgian brewers bucket list the tour of their brewroom and barrelroom seems to have few rivals in the world but i think id like to have a nearby restaurant also because rodenbach seems to know what the kitchen needs ive just had caractere with a simple meal of soup and potatoes my simple meal was vastly improved by caractere a masterpiece,0.4891963635315252,0.9884

2499,Bourbon Paradise,brief review  o i was very surprised to see this was almost a top 100 beer after last years release missed out on that one but was able to grab one this year im maybe just a touch let down by this it comes across a little boozy and hot on the nose and flavor the coconut doesnt really pop for me either mouthfeel is just okay after what looks like a pretty slick pour its a touch messy and could be reigned in a bit for a beer ranked this high i dont think those are unfair criticisms is it still a good beer yes its rich complex and super bourbon forward if you like that but i have a feeling that previous iterations were maybe a bit more solid  recommendation maybe better a couple years ago but this is still a worldclass beer any balover should try,0.48884649803627295,0.9838

2603,Alter Ego,aside from force of will the finest beer in the tree house lineup to my taste  it has the bitterness on the back end that matches the roundness on the front end a tiny bit thin but nothing to complain about  it makes it easier to reach for another  a simply delicious beer that makes your mouth water for another ranks up there with focal banger pliny and intergalactic warrior,0.4880010279750872,0.8937
4112,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,ive been on and off with mosaic for a few years now  im a fan of how soft it makes a beer and fort point is no exception this beer also exemplifies the mosaic effect  its quite green and grassy and while thats great i am not sure that i get the hype the beer is quite drinkable and tasty but its certainly no citrahopping,0.4879118465513204,0.344
5179,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,an exceptional ipa that stands out above a sea full of ipas love getting my hands on this beer love me some fuzzy baby ducks this is a beer everyone needs to try at some point,0.48786498082224955,0.8555
567,Abner,12 oz draft pour at churchkey in dc  hops centennial chinook columbus simcoe warrior  well here it is a legend of vermont craft beer a relic i love edward and this seems to be the double ipa version of that beer i consider it part of the first wave of ne style ipas along with double sunshine and heady topper hugely influential a little darker than most made these days and look at those old school c hops this would have blown my mind in 2012 but now its merely a great beer of many around these days i prefer hfs newer offerings to be perfectly honest but im a lucky son of a bitch to have tried this,0.4876795541885833,0.9711
4677,Adam From The Wood,its definitely a unique beer but not one i think id care to repeat maybe my pallet has been ruined by too many ipas but this beer just wasnt for me the complexity was interesting though and the look and smell were promising but the flavor was too much for me to enjoy regularly,0.487676600176037,0.9246
2524,Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,this 2021 release tastes a bit young when compared with prior years some heat from the alcohol is evident in the first sips and the overall taste is not as rich as i remember in prior years maybe this one needs some aging to reach its potential but its a very good beer now,0.48759208921980546,0.5232
1048,Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,fascinating and very complex beer the chilis come through but are not overpowering this is a sipping beer and im glad i had a small pour at the brewery great stuffive been to cigar city a number of times but this is the first time ive seen hunahpus on tap hooray,0.4875748642957668,0.9571
6063,Black & Wild,was lucky enough to have this one at the source enjoyed at side project taproom with friends and this is one amazing wild very complex and fruity,0.48756284938699,0.9186
984,Chemtrailmix,had this both fresh and aged for what it is worth and i will say that the strength of the cinnamon itself does die down a little given time but even with time this is a cinnabomb and as my favorite adjunct in a stout take the rating with a little sense of bias the cinnamon hidestones down a bit of the sweetness of the overall brew yet seems to be enhanced in flavor a great addition to the ba dl family,0.48743605375566745,0.9555
2098,Beer Geek Vanilla Shake - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,long time want draft pour at vintage estates boardman ohio  l  deep and dark  s  holy fuck layers and layers of molasses carmelized brown sugar bourbonvanilla caramel  t  thats the best beer ive ever had i cant even describe how good it is its like the first time i had bcbs how amazed i was at the depth of the flavors years and thousands of beers later this is blowing me away like bcbs did  f  huge  o  perfect,0.487392398655789,0.9643
295,CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),a few years ago this beer was fantastic now something just is not right maple is very mute chocolate is there more than anything else coffee is non existent pretty much small taste of barrel for me this would just be an ordinary shelfie beer not worth the price,0.4873195988085117,0.7298
3948,Abt 12,this is the best beer i have ever tasted if someone is sick of beer and is questioning if any beer is still worth drinking give them one of these and it will immediately remind them how refreshing a beer can be,0.48722201625940964,0.34
3237,In Perpetuity,traded for this a while ago as the date on the bottom of the can read 9817 with hold on to written above it and sunshine written below it loved the name and label of this beer down to the 92014 on the side which was probably the marriage date referenced in the description this was a typical beer from tree house and a typical new england ipa in the sense that was cloudy juicy and soft but the latter made this so easy to enjoy as the citra and nelson were easy to discern as they worked so harmoniously together  this had a good pour to it as the liquid looked like faded orange juice with just a bit more head present here it held its own and the lacing on the side of my pint glass was quiet extensive as well as the rings were welldefined and nearly bled down to the ones below them tons of orange juice tangerine cream sherbert and muted earthy dankness in the nose as the citrus slickness came through more boldly in the taste melon white grape and a bit of woodsy dankness could be felt in the taste as this almost felt barrelaged but was just a result of the nelson coming through the malt was present as this had body but it was tough to pick out any of it besides a basic doughy presence and the carbonation was sufficient enough to keep this from feeling too heavy  not a lot of alcohol here but what was present could be felt when i finished this off and lend itself to a slight warming feeling that took hold of me before i polished this off just as smooth as the julius or haze this was on par with those while having a bit more depth and earth dankness to it love the idea of this and would love to get my hands on a more recent version of it just to see if its the same take this time around long live this beer in perpetuity,0.48695841097484033,0.9943
4381,Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,this rating is based on the original from a few years ago pours dark brownblack with exceptional thickness the apple brandy melds perfectly to make this an exceptional barrel aged stout for a number of years this was my favorite beer,0.4869216142656704,0.8948
3746,Upper Case,one of the best ipas ive ever had went to trillium over the weekend and tried all the beers on the tap line including upper case along with permutation 52 mentioned in other review this was my favorite beer of the bunch all the others were amazing too including meddle at a close runner up but this one had more complex flavors and smell a great ne ipa style very juicy and very smooth for the abv level i live in nyc and can say this stacks up very well with some of our favorites from other half sand city lic etc,0.4867669936357023,0.9609
1203,Framboise Du Fermier,first of all the smell wow hits your nose and you dont want to pour it drink it out of the bottle my friend im drinking it with said it tastes like a raspberry flintstones vitamin its a great one no doubt,0.486548032289674,0.9492
5865,Omega Point,this is one of the best bba barley wines i have had to date nose on this one was amazing right from the start and then the caramel and bourbon barrel notes are awesome i would love to have more of this asap,0.48636031019191533,0.9538
626,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),i am lucky that i live in a acceptable range to get the westvleteren 12 bottles i always drink this beer after work or after cycling and i dont eat any sugar drinks or food before so i will taste it maximum this is for me the best tasting beer in the world smell and taste is 5,0.48628424886760113,0.8519
4298,DFPF,this might be my favorite berliner of all time i managed to get 5 pours of this at gabf last weekend and i would have gotten more if i had more time this is insanely sour fruity and perfectly carbed,0.48627615303630184,0.802
4411,Hopslam Ale,my first time with this brew i was a bit taken aback but my second third and fourth times were much more appreciative hopslam lives up to its nameyou down one of these and you know it higher alcohol content and and a sweeter taste than its cousin two hearted both are great beers,0.4859126692391153,0.9184
5174,Fuzzy Baby Ducks,traded for this a while ago as there wasnt a date on the bottom of the can wasnt sure what to expect out of this as the beer was quite old when i finally cracked it open and although it wasnt bad i dont see how it earned the lofty rating that it had on here  the pour to this was alright as the liquid had a orange blossom hue to it with plenty of white bubbly head to top it off most of the thin lacing was around the top of my pint glass with a few scattered splotches below it lots of citrus juice and rind in the nose with some dank tropical notes and pine as well it wasnt bad but at this point ive had so many beers with those notes that this seemed like something else ive had before but couldnt quite remember exactly what that characteristic was true for the taste as well given how slick sweet and somewhat heavy this was but once again it wasnt anything noteworthy or outstanding to me as the malt was certainly there but not anything that added or detracted to this beers flavor profile  the amount of alcohol in this was typical as well with just enough to give this some heft but not enough to easily felt or detected a date on the bottom of the can might have helped but as it was i would love to give this another go with something fresher a mild dry hop burn took hold as i finished this off and there was just a little bit of sediment at the bottom of the liquid but as it was this was a beer that was as prototypical as a new englad ipa could get,0.4858479103381901,0.9876
5424,Thicket,one of my favorite side project beers still had that typical side project lacto but the fruit comes through in this one much more than a lot of their other beers,0.48569889364525076,0.25
2616,Last Buffalo In The Park,man this beer ruled when i first had it definitely one to drink fresh and not age ton of coconut and barrel i dont hear a ton about fb these days but this beer was great,0.48567546382745863,0.8462
6209,Second Fiddle,picked up a four pack at beer store today and didnt know too much about it saw the ratings and i was stoked this is a well balanced dipa i am a big fan of the super hazy neipas and this is not overly smoggy but it is delicious this is a great brew for a warm afternoon on the front porch,0.48560064837146394,0.9565
5483,Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,bba expedition stout was the white whale i have been endlessly searching for the base beer has been a favorite of mine for 2 years and i finally found the ba version in grand rapids mi the base russian remains predominant and is blended with the sticky bourbon one of the very few beers where the base beer beats the barrel headtohead the nose is 1010 and tops off the experience  ig firesidewithphil,0.48555057952617636,0.875
376,Assassin,smells like a 2012 stout recipe a tad perfumey reminds me of the eclipse series really well done sometimes its hard to realize something that comes close to flawless unless we have the accompanying hype but this is very good also makes we want to go back and find those eclipse bottles,0.48553029874825177,0.8586
1824,Swish,i had a draft of this at the brewery in portland me i have to admit i wasnt impressed it tasted mildly soapy to me the ipa present notes of pine and citrus and some mango were there for me but i just couldnt get rid of the soapy note and it felt unbalanced to me  the colour and smell were fine  the mouthfeel was indistinguishable to just about any other ipa ive had but there was just nothing overly special about this beer id rate it way below sip of sunshine or very green by treehouse its clear this has some of the same notes as a treehouse ipa but overall it just doesnt feel as balanced its like hearing a hs symphony band vs the boston pops id rate this slightly under a king sue or greater good  overall i just wasnt a fan as they say in the bronx its just aiiiight,0.4854004923138211,0.9387
5016,Gueuze 100% Lambic,what i like about cantillons regular geuze is that its perhaps the most different tasting geuze of all oude geuzes but its still a quintessential geuze beautiful beer,0.4853533835135214,0.7964
4549,Impermanence,500 ml bottle dated november 2018 drank november 2019 while cellared properly this still didnt taste as smooth and sweet as it shouldlesson learned  either th stouts dont survive the test of time even if no major adjuncts the lactose doesnt age well or something else either way ill definitely give this one another try and rereview as soon as i can grab a fresh can,0.48520027056523923,0.2928
2364,Trappistes Rochefort 10,delicious trappist ale price cant be beat compared to westvelten this is a go to beer for fall  winter cant believe how close this is to the westv the lack of a creamy finiah is the real difference,0.4847101930820908,0.34
4045,Double Nelson,my scores just tell it all freekin amazing taste and look and feel good things for my taste buds if you dont think this beer is superior it is my humble feeling that you havent got a clue about finely crafted ipas new england or otherwise,0.4846382411848406,0.8934
1646,Black Tuesday,solodomed a 2011 vintage on boxing day i love how this has mellowed out over the years still verry boozy but not as sweet as fresh way better balance id say and still holding up well,0.48447644317123195,0.833
2780,Cutting Tiles - Mosaic,picked this up at trillium in boston 10 days ago and drank one of them that night it was very good but a bit bitter had another one tonight and it was bursting with juiciness and flavor my mouth is watering might be worth leaving in the fridge for a week or two this is one of the best trillium beers thus the best beers ive ever had definitely the best double ipa ive ever had,0.4844268991890911,0.9741
2359,Trappistes Rochefort 10,absolutely one of the very best beers ive ever had of any style  clean and crisp with many complex subtleties that other have already described better than i could it does a pretty good job of masking its abv too so be careful  as far as quads go for me its either this or st bernardus abt 12 i cant decide which is better both are brilliant those belgian monks know how to party,0.48432788552206313,0.9787
3262,Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,remember that guitar hero commercial from way back when with heidi klum wearing nothing but a white button up shirt and socks jamming out like nobodys watching to bob segers old time rock and roll holding a guitar hero controller  well that was pretty much me after taking one sip of ba sump  i dont know if its because i hadnt had beer in a while or because this particular drinking session happened after threefour weeks worth of very stressful life events but for some reason i felt a sudden rush of incredible euphoria the exact moment the precious black liquid passed between my lips and my neurotransmitters started firing back signals trying to decode the wonderment beckoning my palatal and olfactory senses  i guess this is why im still obsessed with a hobby thats detrimental to both my health and bank account which gifts me with nothing but splitting headaches and cottonmouth in the mornings while stealing my gains at the gym  in all sincerity regular sump is quite possibly the most coffeeforward beer ive ever tried when i say that its coffeeforward i dont mean the kind that your secretary serves you in a white styrofoam cup lukewarm with creamer and two spoons of sugar i mean the straightup bold illustrious flavors that emanate out of fresh roasted beans that may or may not have been burnt beyond the sixth layer of hell because you get your coffee at starbucks id argue that the coffeeness in sumps coffee is more coffee than most coffee in a way a rose is a rose is a rose is not a rose but im probably getting ahead of myself at this point so ill stop  the aroma coming out of the bottle is very much similar to its nonba kin so much coffee that you dont quite know whether you want to try and heat it up and drink it black or put it in a cheap reusable plastic cup with ice sugar and saturated fats and serve it with a dollop of whipped cream on top  after some time and temperature however the commanding sweetness shares its spot on the podium with a light hint of chocolate and sweet cream cluing you in that other elements may be at play  i havent had a beer that was this straightforward since weyerbachers sunday morning stout in fact for those of you that have tried sunday morning and are somewhat familiar with crossfit sunday morning is to annie þórisdóttir what ba sump is to katrin davíðsdóttir for those of you that dont have a clue what that means theyre both world class beers that id drink again without batting an eye but the latter edges out the former as a more robust allround mesh of bourbon and coffee flavors  in plain speak i have yet to try a beer that comes close to the perfect marriage of coffee and rye whiskey that ive witnessed in ba sump neither flavor eclipses the other while neither is expressed at less than 100 of its expressable potential  hell you might as well throw a scalding cup of coffee and a glass of whiskey in my face simultaneously and id get all the same sensations albeit without the masterful blending and delicious flavors,0.48425453151029185,0.983
2326,Breakfast Stout,a decent stout that i forgot to log when i drank it i could get the coffee and chocolate but it still lacked the thickness that i was looking for at 82 abv it still lacked the punch that i was looking for,0.48413775103326495,0.09
40,Marshmallow Handjee,split the 2018 version with 2 friends ill blame the perpetual hype but imho this was just a pretty good vanilla stout not 5 times better than fo certainly not 23 times as good as henna marshmallow yes the vanilla balance was perfect but honestly it started to wobble a bit as it warmed up not worth the price tag hoping for a different variant this year,0.48413174456910296,0.9854
4493,Double Barrel Jesus,shared the 2017 version of this beauty with a couple friends last night and it was great had it alongside both the maple syrup barrel evil twin releases from this year and the double barrel jesus was better than either of them nice boozy finish which will calm a bit as it ages i hope since i have a 2015 dbj in the cellar but has a ton of chocolate and bourbon on the nose and palate,0.48408538689588154,0.8689
3974,Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),bottle poured inky black minimal head i as i believe most love and have loved this label for years finally got around to trying it honestly i thought it was lacking in barrel character the other flavors and aromas were tasty but i think it needed more barrel still good i actually believe i had the port version a few years ago and remember liking that one more than this,0.48407496087644775,0.9324
2262,The Broken Truck,shockingly tasty  i know its very highly rated but for some reason i just didnt trust it to be as good as it was very easy drinking with a wonderful overall flavor probably my favorite de garde to date,0.4840338935114034,0.9359
1539,Citra,best ipa ive ever had i waited years to finally get a case of citra and the wait was worth it scary drive to the brewery to pick up the case but it was a fantastic trip numerous great beers but citra stood out actually they had hazy citra on tap and it was wonderful if you get a chance to try it dont pass it up,0.4839319588071317,0.9684
96,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,had sidebyside with kbbs and it won the night retains all the amazing notes of regular abraxas with a perfect barrel character and mouth feel amazing beer,0.4839098829996936,0.9432
5731,Imperial Eclipse Stout - Elijah Craig (12 Year),loved this at 23 years old but a 5year old bottle tasted phenomenal still wellcarbonated and a bit more honey presence than i remember previously on the whole kind of on the sweeter side but what an amazing bourbon barrel loads of flavor and very smooth for nearly 12 considering the age on it this surpassed expectations on all fronts wish i had another cuz the 2015 vintage will keep on truckin for sure,0.4838245944403256,0.9343
1904,Chocolate Rain,022015  2013 vintage  wow this is exactly what i wanted from this black tuesday variant the chocolate takes it to the next level  big fan the mouthfeel is even better too,0.4834688721292905,0.8402
4819,Matt,another unique and wonderful brew from hotd id call it somewhere between an american strong and an old ale but that doesnt matter because its just delicious after a couple years in my cellar the carbonation has suffered a bit but many of hotds offerings start out that way so it doesnt seem a problem nose and taste are both truly world class so complex and so well integrated that i cant begin to describe them  you just have to be here,0.4834314623964053,0.9381
162,Mornin' Delight,i tasted this at the brewery jan 7 2020 i also had term oil maple cakes and assassin vanilla bean in the same flight i have had it other times when that was the best beer in the flight while those other two dominated this it is an outstanding beer and love to drink it when ever i can get it,0.4832521383448233,0.9246
5722,Fort Point Pale Ale,the first thing i said when i tasted this beer was pineappley goodness and ill stick to that the overwhelming flavor of this beer is certainly what you notice but behind that its actually pretty balanced i thought it was a bit less hazy than most of the recent new englandstyle beers but i get why this is their main apa and id bet it is one of their two or three biggest sellers too,0.48324653013792945,0.7269
2078,Flora Plum,this is probably the best hill farmstead beer ive had it takes floras great base beer and blends perfectly with the plums to create a something amazing id drink one of these a day if i could it was that good,0.48313191253005267,0.9694
1297,Headroom,another trillium winner excellent balance in all respects this brewery does it really well and this has just about everything a drinker would want in a hazy new england ipa nice,0.48310611864740927,0.9359
120,Heady Topper,worth the hype pretty much everything that can be said has been great complex flavor with an especially outstanding dry hop finish really an excellent excellent brew note i gave the look a 5 even though i couldnt see it since i drank it from a can like a proper citizen,0.4830381663717715,0.9748
6135,Darkstar November,2017 bottle opened with a couple fellow ba members would put this ahead of many of the ba stouts i have consumed this year by a large margin thick fudge brownie it was still a bit warming so i imagine it may have been quite hot when fresh,0.48291865351494023,0.4877
1364,Rare Scooop,this is one of the most unique and most impressive beers i have ever had you get to taste every bit of the neapolitan ice cream in the description in all the best ways definitely a dessert beer but not at all too sweet in my opinion a wonderful experience,0.4827879300344897,0.9413
2000,Resolute - Coconut,hands down one of the most perfect beers ive had i hear its similar to prop 13 but have trouble imagining that prop is better clearly i need to try it im a big fan of stouts but generally favor soursipas id take a bottle of coconut resolute over almost any beer out there  while i tasted pure coconut it was not overbearing it almost reminded me of a samoa girl scout cookie which happens to be my favorite its an absolute treat and nearly impossible to taste alcoholvery impressive for 135,0.482480733657917,0.9808
5015,Gueuze 100% Lambic,gueuze 100 lambic 2018 the most recent was the 2018 vintage and i drank it on tap in september 2020 at porknroll day 2020 according to my tastes still young designed for the consumer who wants to take cantillon but would then be shocked to hear an acid that is too strong always to the eye you smell that suggests that the bretta still has to work light mold and cereals in the mouth a very light acid very salable the best edition ive tasted of this beer is that of 2008 and i drank it towards the end of 2018 acid that definitely took off and made the beer more astringent and elegant in the cellar i keep several vintages of this beer and i think the bretta is characterizing them a little more,0.4823057735091878,0.9571
2236,Triple Shot,pickedup a single bottle at the tree house brewery in charlton for 12 my ninety ninth brew from these guys brew  3 in th stout day off this week pretty good a bit teep,0.48229036966100547,0.7783
1346,Rare Scooop,holy moly cycle just scooped me up the hype is real on this one first thing i tastel is chocolate followed by vanilla and ending with some strawberry goodness you need to try this asap,0.4820312057144663,0.4588
1075,Double Citra®,i live in maine i thought the best beer made in america was dinner maine beer co i was wrong the best beer made in america is double citra  hill farmstead incredible  hard to find  dirt road  no reception its worth it,0.4819066598110531,0.4417
2904,Pirate Paradise,two of my friends recently put together a share to help me out after my bottles were stolen at dark lord day i told them it really wasnt necessary but that seems to have even motivated them more so we ended up drinking several top 250 beers which is always exciting for me  i was stunned that they managed to grab a pirate paradise though im a very big fan of bourbon paradise and a huge lover of prairie beers in general  this was certainly a wish list item  so its a little odd to say that i was slightly let down by pirate paradise  particularly as difficult as id thought it was to find and procure strangely it seems that bourbon seems to complement the base beer much better  which is exactly what i would not have thought rum and coconut beers are some of my favorites  so why didnt this one work quite as well for me  thats probably not exactly a good or accurate statement honestly because pirate paradise is a damn good beer  but where bourbon paradise is almost too thick and sweet this beer falls just a little short in those categories rum in the nose and the taste are pleasant but its definitely a bit thin in that im also not getting the coconut and vanilla to nearly the same degree as in bourbon paradise quite surprising i know  so while i like pirate paradise  i cant help but review it in the long shadow cast by bourbon paradise,0.48154630849377744,0.9987
4708,Crusher,circumstances pint can poured into a clear pint glass no worries theres not as much head expected as if it were a neipa expectations met little head and little glass lace i smell hops and for a reason theyre in there this is likely the best tasting beer ive ever had i also dont know another beverage with this much alcohol that hides it as well maybe not perfect in every category but just about the best in the ones that matter most,0.48154069643033154,0.8811
4407,Hopslam Ale,great super hoppy beer it was one of the first really hoppy beers i ever had and i fell in love i was sad it only came out once a year but when it does i buy as much as i can afford,0.4811406014733541,0.6757
2377,Miami Madness,had this at aslins second anniversary the look is an unmistakable pinkish purple color and the taste is quite different if you arent into sour type beers you might pass for what it is though you will likely find no better,0.4808701902955286,-0.3412
3437,Double Dry Hopped Double Mosaic Dream,feels smells and looks exactly like my favorite neipas when i drink it though i could be convinced its a peach ipa which i wasnt sure would be a winner but this is a damn good beer,0.4807596042037951,0.7021
3555,Fundamental Forces,wish i could have this side by side with fo i really think its every bit as good possibly even more bourbon and vanilla if my memory serves me right,0.4807411106683681,0.6808
217,King JJJuliusss,yeah well worth the wait all the hype surrounding this beer was well deserved color is glowingly orange and i was stuck between wanting to savor and chug,0.4805920205034693,0.6486
3,Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,i have now had 4 different years of kbbs and continue to feel this beer is in a realm of its own the look is as dark as burnt motor oil the smell is filled with maple coffee bourbon and stout outside of 2020 the taste is super sticky with a huge mouth feel  i would say i rate 2018 as being the best year followed by 2019 then 2018 and i would rate 2020 last,0.48057620907348564,0.9022
1465,It Was All A Dream,very rarely do i give a 5 for every category but there just really isnt any other choice here  the first thing you notice is the coconut floaties now im not talking about the occasional sprinkle you get with cycle or other decent ba coconut stouts the chunks of coconut just come flowing out unreal this beer is so thick too coats the glass  smell is amazing no one adjunct stands out above the rest same with the taste absolutely incredible  mouthfeel is where this truly shines i have never had a beer where people were smacking their lips minutes after taking each sip we all were amazed at how much this beer stuck to your mouth like syrup  truly one of the top 3 beers ive had and if im being honest which is hard for an indiana local to admit it might be better than handjee for the top spot seek out as many as you can you wont be disappointed,0.48042007669143805,0.9877

5562,Ghost In The Machine,12oz bottle i like how it says manifested on then the date thats just cute as my granny would say this beer is only 2 weeks old part of the reason i grabbed it not much better in the beer world than a fresh double citra ipa so glad i grabbed this one once i looked it up and saw all the glowing reviews it was also the last one on the shelf which to me is always a good sign when shopping  finding very fresh beer that is almost sold out simply tells me that ive found good beer huge thanks  shouts to the guy that left 1 last 4pack  this beer is super hazy i mean its sitting there looking like a big golden milkshake with a gigantic pillowtop of creamy offwhite head the head was so thick and malleable it was like a lump of white jello sitting atop my beer i wont even hesitate before calling it the greatest head ive ever seen on a beer this is a fantastic brew just to sit and look at completely a work of art here its a damn shame it doesnt smell better the scent is nice just muted i have to dig to find that signature citra stinky armpit hop smell the taste is nothing to write home about either but it is balanced very nicely with the surprisingly substantial malt presence and the abv is high but shows up only in how dry this one can be this is definitely one dangerous beer sitting at 85  its like drinking a good pilsner thats how smooth and easy it goes down  delicious beer from new orleans purchased and enjoyed in beautiful fort myers florida like most citra bombs this was freaking dank not the best citra beer ive had but its definitely up there i cant complain either drinking this out by the water with my family times like those are what i live for but the taste of this beer will forever be associated with that memory of this april the 20th spent with my uncle grandmother and sister cheers to life we only get so see each other so often and i love every minute of every visit i savor it like a good beer kinda like this good bier in fact i wish my dad were here too life would be that much more awesome but im learning it wasnt meant to be i drink this one for him though  i love you dad i know youre awaiting us on that next big step that we all have to take some day and i for one will be leaping with joy to join you on the other side cheers to all my fellow beer advocators as well the alström brothers they made my favorite beer site ever by a mile and ive never cheersd them on their own site  the shame so cheers alström brothers and anyone who made it to the end of this reviewdiatribe  i owe you a beer love and peace to all its what the world is made from,0.48027599853899505,0.9991
644,Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),this beer absolutely deserves the hype in fact this is the best beer i have ever tasted i agree with most of the previous favourable comments re its taste smell mouthfeel and absurdly quaffable nature particularly given the 102 abv but i would also like to add that i completely agree with those who recommend a 1216 degree celsius drinking temperature this means you take one out of your cupboardsafebank vault and put it in the fridge for only 1520 minutesthe complexity really comes through at this temperature in contrast a friend once drank a cold one as a travel beer on the tube subwaymetro on his way home at midnight when heavily drunk obviously he is no longer a friend  in summary this beer tastes like an angels vagina and anyone giving it less than a 49 are just upset theyve had to acquire it for 20 a bottle from a dodgy character on a street corner at 2am rather than from a happy monk at the saintsixtus abbey,0.4802047016197113,0.9747

4659,Adam From The Wood,2015 purchased online from hotd aged at least 3 years in bourbon barrels the tasting notes on their website said there would be no carbonation but i did get a few big bubbles  adam from the wood comes across as aged two syllables ageed not one and venerable he is ponderous and methodical slow to get to the point he is perhaps a bit past his prime flabby in the midsection with thinning hair  trying to stay youthful adam wears a lot of leather these days it still smell faintly of the cigars he gave up years ago he can usually be found at a fading bar nursing a watery bourbon on the rocks with the ice long melted and munching maraschino cherries pondering what was and wondering if it will be again  if you ever get the chance to spend some time with him do it he knows a lot of good stories and has a hell of a good sense of humor,0.4799481151425142,0.8271
1210,Framboise Du Fermier,way too damn sour puckering to say the least raspberries are normally one of my personal favorites added to a sour but this is utterly acidic and rough cant say id go after this again not my jam and the side project label is what is carrying this in my opinion,0.47987795059370864,0.0129

1848,Sip Of Sunshine,on tap at the tavern downtown in hartford ct  this beer did not blow me away and so i thought about why folks might be giving it the ratings that they do in part it is because this beer has a reputation as being one of the early great imperial ipas for me what makes this a great beer is that it has retained its original profile which is certainly more west coast ipa than anything found in vermont the bitterness is not over the top but its just enough to balance the 8 abv to make you think youre drinking a beer with much less alcohol pliny and ruination are better but this is a great beer,0.479466342004122,0.8886

1845,Sip Of Sunshine,idk i see all the ratings and maybe my palette is fried today but this is outrageously bland probably need to just try it again this is doing literally nothing at all for me   update i am upping my rating but in this modern day i wasnt mindblown and its a very light tasting ipa to me and not bursting with flavor and definitely not aroma that said this is definitely really good still,0.47906933352499054,0.8552
1003,Zombie Dust,howdy everybody good to be back man oh man i havent done an actual review in a century hell ive barely done more than the occasional review over the past few years dont blame me blame the fact craft is dying where im at  saw this posted by a local liquor store and knew i had to have the legend i remember hearing so much about over the years here we go  look  yellowish orange with a finger of white head fairly hazy though twinges of clarity low lace upon a finished glass  smell  floral and seems to be loaded to the brim with mosaic i remember so fondly before the juice bomb phase of beer decided to rear its head  taste  straight floral with some grapefruit goodness  feel  right here is where i feel this beer really shines through this is probably the smoothest paleipa i have ever had in my near decade of drinking the crafts goes down silky smooth almost like water but the body isnt watery does that make sense probably not but you get itmaybe no im serious ive almost finished the glass and didnt even notice low bitterness even if it sits seriously how did fff manage to achieve this smoothness it doesnt even seem real  overall  while i do not feel the flavors live up to the legendary status this is absolutely the smoothest paleipa you are ever going to find anywhere this will impress new craft drinkers and the seasoned veteran all the same 1399 in my opinion is a bit stiff for a sixer but if you want something flavorful that you can throw back in a pinch without any of the cloying sweetness and or bitterness that some of these brews can eventually take on this is your guy,0.4788530724902285,0.6142

4650,Appervation,so there were what four or five weeks on beer advocate where everyone was posting trades for appervation right i sure hope all of those traders were happy with what they received i ended up receiving my bottle in a slightly unplanned way  i hadnt been in to the hype but was still pleased to locate and try a bottle  but cautious i was skeptical of the hype and didnt want to be disappointed ive been hurt too many times in the past  i made the mistake of giving this one a shot when it was still too cold the carbonation was practically nonexistent  only the tiniest little foaming tipped me off that the bottle hadnt gone bad relief the alcohol notes are definitely a bit unpleasant when the beer is still cold  its probably the worst example ive found recently of how stouts are very temperaturesensitive but after it warms up  the chocolate and bourbon come alive the alcohol remains strongly in the nose taste and mouth feel but the flavors open up wonderfully  appervation is quite good  but in all honesty id have traded mine in a moment for another bottle of double barrel dark apparition,0.47769619059651797,0.9001

98,Barrel-Aged Abraxas,lucky enough to get a tip of when this was tapping at this years great taste of the midwest otherwise i probably would have missed it because with so many beers to try i find it hard to keep track of when specific beers are being tapped but i am very grateful that i was near the perennial tent around 200 when they started pouring what turned out to be one of the best beers i have ever had  regular abraxas has always been one of my favorite beers i was curious to see what barrel aging would do to adjuncts that are already in a fairly perfect balance it was amazing how the barrel stood out but yet still allowed all of the other flavors to shine through the beer almost tasted like a candy bar but was not overly sweet in anyway the barrel muted the adjuncts slightly but if possible put them into even more of a perfect balance than the regular version  this years great taste took place on a fairly hot day making barrel aged stouts a bit harder to drink but this stood out by far and i easily would have downed another pour had it not been in such great demand,0.4764391611890168,0.9948

1812,Double Dry Hopped Fort Point Pale Ale,even though i had to fly to boston and drive to canton  ddh fort point was well worth it  its funny because i really really enjoy the base beer  fort point  and had badly wanted ddh fort point for some time but when i planned my trip to boston i didnt think about that one particular beer at all id hoped that tree house might have a special release or something but didnt give trillium a second though lo and behold i ended up getting bottles and cans of several permutations  and finally had the joy of ddh fort point on tap  the beer pours beautiful a nice yellowgold with a clean white head it smells richly of citrus i couldnt believe how free of bitterness it was  just a bit of light dryness and tons of juice ive occasionally scoffed at ddh beers that just dont seem any better than the base this is not one of those beers ddh fort point was absolutely worth the wait my only lament is that it was not available in cans,0.4732084728527792,0.97
2251,The Broken Truck,batch 5 bottled january 2019 drank over two nights in september 2019 first from a hill farmstead stemmed wineglass then from a tree house teku  a beautiful looking beer that hit all the right notes from the look feel and smell departments same as others have described the taste again hitting on those same descriptions was good but for me it ended up being just too acidic i even had to ditch the last couple ounces as my stomach had had enough usually im ok with excessively wild wilds etc but the acidity for this version of bt only one ive tried was off the charts for me  it didnt actually taste overly acidic the taste was really pretty good it was more the effect that the acidic component had on my stomach i have read this in a couple other reviews so not sure if this is typical of all bts or if it was more isolated to this batch or maybe some more time in the bottle would have helped either way it was a bit of a disappointment especially for a beer that i had waited so long to try and so eagerly anticipated,0.4731597027274872,0.8766

3080,Parabajava,this review comes with an asterisk which is that i must have had a somewhat off experience with this one in that there is no way the whole world loves this so much and i found it unremarkable i have wanted to try this for a long long time and was so stoked to finally get the chance but i suspect a distributor or an account or even the brewery held on to this keg for way too long knowing they had something special here and wanting to save it for just the right moment well to me it tastes like that moment had long passed by the time this one was flowing the coffee tastes and smells stale and it has seemingly broken down some of the body that makes this base beer so monumental what i can appreciate is what its supposed to be a rich espresso layer over one of the most flavorful and interesting stouts to ever exist an unnecessary but fancy layer a little green peppery now and a little acidic and thinning but probably absurdly appealing in its prime the alcohol is somehow really well hidden maybe one benefit of its apparent age cant believe its as strong as it is some nice dark chocolate and char to this still plenty of barrel on it too faint vanilla and tobacco as well lots happening but wonderful integration at the same time i enjoyed this still a lot impossible not to but in this instance certainly not one of the best beers in the world i know what it can be though and i cant wait to try it under more idea conditions until next time,0.47125957426232007,0.9959

5046,Coffee Abraxas,abraxas has always been one of my favorite stouts without a doubt im excited to have some 19 coffee on draft at beer temple chicago the thing that makes this special is the balance between all the adjuncts and incredible full mouthfeel and body this is worth the hype and would only ask for a barrel aged version for something potentially better,0.4667360654229906,0.9251

5051,Coffee Abraxas,one of the highest beers remaining on my personal want to drink list so i was overjoyed to see it on offer at the brewery when we were there recently its been one ive always wanted to try and to get it have it side by side next to the original was a nice a thing as i could imagine after careful study i have to say as delicious and awesome as this is abraxas doesnt need the coffee not that i was let down or disappointed by this not at all quite the opposite its stunning but the original is the original it has such perfect balance and the dark malt in it does everything that coffee would making the coffee almost superfluous thus in the coffee edition they have to add so much coffee to push it through the grain that it seems almost a touch out of balance or rather more coffee driven at the expense of the other added ingredients not out of balance the balance is still huge and awesome i just get a little less from the cinnamon and pepper in here than i do in the original the coffee is a lot its bitter for sure and it also has just a little acidity that kind of interrupts the smoothness the other one has the depth of this is insane though and in the coffee i also get leather burnt wood smoke and chocolate really compelling it has nice linger sexy warmth going down and feels as fancy as it is a rarity i feel so lucky to have encountered in this fashion by surprise right at the source as epic as this is i still think with a gun to my head i pick the original yeah i said it still this is as good a coffee stout as you will ever find wow worth the wait,0.46655230342627996,0.9961

4111,Fort Point Pale Ale - Mosaic Dry Hopped,yeah this is old as the date on the bottom of the can read 10417 and yes i have a ton of beer to get through here at my house with that being said i wasnt sure why this was rated so high maybe its the name on the label or the nature of the hopping but overall this was an average beer that didnt stand out in any particular way to me even if there was hardly any sediment from it being in my basement for all this time  not a bad pour to this as the liquid was a deep apricot with enough fluffy head to top it off quite cloudy only a bit of sediment floated in it and hardly any light got in around the edges very little soapy lacing was seen along the back of my pint glass as i worked my way through this which was a bit of a surprise loads of mosaic dankness grass and forest in the muted nose as they all came through in the taste nothing heavy here and the barley stood out more than anything else in the taste as this felt quite full but uninspiring at the same time a lack of easily discernible bitterness stood out to me as this went right down and although it wasnt bad it needed quite a bit more to stand out from trilliums other offerings that ive had  not a lot of booze here either as this was the epitome of what a generic american pale ale is in my eyes i need to get a fresh can of this but given how well their other offerings have held up well over time this one was a bit of a letdown i prefer the regular fort point and know that its me and not them when it comes to how low i rated this needs another go before i fully write it off,0.4586312882690125,0.9389
1513,Lou Pepe - Framboise,bottle with a 2013 sticker reluctant to rate because this is such a distinctive beer at once subtle and strong and this is the first time ive had anything by cantillon i found it amazing but also palate challenging its kind of like first time listening to coltrane youre not sure how to describe it or judge it and youre at once thrilled and in over your head but you know repetition seems really worth pursuing and will alter your tastes,0.4578919733039601,0.8991

2626,Last Buffalo In The Park,i have had a few of these through the years always excellent but for whatever reason 2019 feels a bit boozy at the end prior years loved the roasty grainy after taste still better than 9095 of what is out there,0.45757343537134293,0.9109

2922,Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,im a huge fan of fremonts barrel aging program and even as goose island sold out bourbon county remains a brew to benchmark against it is rare to meet a ba stout of this caliber and this is exactly what we have with the bba speedway its good  better than bcbs on their off years maybe better than their best,0.45709444246627384,0.9531
