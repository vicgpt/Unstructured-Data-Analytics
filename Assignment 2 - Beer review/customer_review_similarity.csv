I have a four ounce pour .   look : the pour be thick like motor oil . it ’s super dark with minimal head . it ’s syrupy in the great way . when swirl , the the beer nearly stain the glass brown leave amazing leg .   Smell : this be incredible . for many beer , you pick up subtle aroma . for this beer , you immediately get in - your - face maple syrup follow by coffee , bourbon , and dark chocolate . there be nothing subtle about these aroma . you do n’t have to try to identify they . you can smell they from the moment the glass be place on the table — it ’s as if they ’re serve you breakfast .   taste : much like smell , there be nothing subtle about the flavor . once again , the maple hit you hard immediately with bold flavor of chocolate chip pancake with butter . the coffee / espresso flavor come next accompany by bourbon . the flavor be extremely bold , deep , and well - balanced . it ’ a symphony of flavor . perfection .   feel : I debate on include sweetness in the flavor , but it my opinion , this particular sweetness be more about feel than flavor . you can have flavor without sweetness . I ’ve place it here because the sweetness contribute in such a way that the entire feel of the beer be elevate . it add a richness that ’ hard to describe . it eliminate any boozy feeling while keep the warmth you get from a high ABV drink . it ’ coat your mouth entirely and the feel and flavor last a long time .   overall : I do n’t typically prefer stout , but killer stout be topple Goliath ’s bread and butter . I be worried that I could potentially be disappoint due to all the hype surround this beer . not only do it live up to the hype , it exceed my own expectation . it leave I want more .

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged,"2016 batch ( # 2 ) review .   Hunahpu 's be one of those beer that I love the very first time I try it , and I 've be chase that dragon ever since ... unsuccessfully , as it turn out .   I 've be lucky enough to try Barrel - aged Huna twice now - once at great American Beer Fest , and for a second time when I win a bottle in a charity raffle . as it turn out , I drink my BA Huna alongside of double Barrel Huna , expect that I would be blow away by the double Barrel ... in fact , it be the exact opposite experience .   and perhaps I should have expect that , give the barrel use in DB Huna - Rum and Apple Brandy barrel do n't often tend to impart much thickness to a beer , and in combination , they definitely make the beer seem a bit thin . additionally , where the bourbon barrel in BA Huna add depth , richness , sweetness , and complexity , it seem that Double Barrel just take on thinness and acidity . it be also quite charred in taste - it remind I quite a bit of my gripe with 2018 Huna . sadly , all of that cinnamon and vanilla that I love seem to be entirely absent . it be still a sweet beer , but it be greatly overshadow by the barrel note and char and acidity .   in the end , I honestly think I 've find myself prefer non - barrel - aged Huna as my go - to . it be certainly easy to get , and something about it be just a much more pleasant experience for I . yes , I have a sweet tooth , so that be probably a big part of it . or perhaps Cigar City 's age method just be n't to my liking . maybe the barrel ? tough to say - more experimentation require !",0.2182178902359924

Caramel , toffee , vanilla fudge , chocolate fudge , malt milk ball , almond - coconut chocolate bar , brownie batter , vanilla cake frosting , white cake batter , and a vanilla intensity that start to mimic cream cheese frost . some splintery white oak and dusty rackhouse note thread through . as it warm , more chocolate , roast , and bourbon emerge . * note * - this really open up after several minute and the bean cool off a lot , let that stout and barrel emerge .   palate : fundamental Observation greet the palate with barrel - age stouty goodness . chocolate , fudge , brownie batter , some supremely balanced roast , oak , woody vanillin , malt milk ball , caramel , toffee , brown sugar , bourbon , and barrel char , before the vanilla bean smoothly turn up the volume and come into focus . the vanilla be much more natural and properly integrate here , show you that they be very much here , but that there be also stout and barrel share the field . Vanilla bean , vanilla frosting , vanilla cake batter , but blend nicely with the stout , give it this vanilla - frost chocolate brownie thing go on . no real dark fruit to speak of . approach the finish , each sip have this brief moment where everything be vanilla , and then everything become bourbon ( actually close to rye if I be fussing ) , and then the chocolatey roast and malty note enter back in . the finish itself highlight plenty of oak and bourbon , vanilla bean , cocoa , and roast , as the sweetness entirely disappear , allow oak and roast to dry it out . a lengthy aftertaste of barrel and vanilla linger on .   Mouthfeel / body : this one be nicely thick , chewy , hefty , and viscous . it be not syrupy , cloy , or ridiculous . there be some light effervescence underneath , and it find that balance between big , thick , and chewy , without get in the way or become overbearing . coat the lip some , but that barrel really dry out and clean up the finish . some warmth go down , but never hot .   overall : Vanilla stout be hard . I adore a great one , but great one be hard to come by . BCBS Vanilla be a great one . I 'll need to compare , but this be easily up there . BCBSV have more vanilla ( maybe too much ) , and way more dark fruit , with less oak , and less body . this find more balance , more stouty character , more fudge , oak , and bourbon , and a well body . it be a fantastic display of vanilla , and definitely one worth try . I think there could be well vanilla stout out there , but for what it be , this 2019 be definitely enjoyable .",0.12137942580688092

Hunahpu 's be Cigar City 's most famous stout and it be release at an event that be essentially similar to Dark Lord Day . we crack this one , in addition to several other big name goody , to celebrate the end of the Illinois bar exam , my birthday , and Robbie Moy 's birthday . score : 97   Counter - pressurized growler be from the summer 2012 release . serve in a wine chalice , share with friend and enjoy on 07/28/12 . review be from note .   appearance : pour a pitch black color with a nice layer of cappuccino - color head that settle to a ring around the glass . very oily , coat lace with a solid cling factor . 4/5   Smell : what a delicious medley . Fudge and sweet dark chocolate impart a bittersweetness . then brown sugar , a little dark fruit and vanilla , and a sweet rum - like aroma that must come from the apple brandy aging then tip the balance of the nose towards sweet . the oak , pepper and a hint of cinnamon then give the beer a nice spice anchor to the sweetness . there be a touch of booziness as the beer warm up , but nothing powerful or off - put or overwhelming in the least . this be a really excellent nose ! 4.75/5   taste : Chocolatey fudge , smooth vanilla and a sweet apple - and - watermelon - like rum flavor ( almost like a smooth and less sugary Bacardi grand melon flavor that be nothing like the off - flavor be report in some bottle of the 2012 vintage of Dark Lord ) be my first impression . there be a faint oakiness and chili pepper flavor at first on the side of the tongue that modestly grow as the beer warm and layer on the tongue . the apple brandy aging seem to have mellow out the pepper heat substantially in comparison to the base beer , but there be still a little bit of life leave in the pepper and the smooth , subtle heat they give off on the side of the tongue and the roof of the mouth give the beer a nice bold complexity that make the bitterness from the chocolate / fudge flavor pop on the tongue . the chocolate and rum sweetness really soak the tongue in flavor and linger with the faint pepper heat . there be some mild dark fruit flavor and a hint of molasse as well , though the aroma have more of each present . 4.75/5   Mouthfeel : rich , thick and viscous . full bodied and very low carbonation . there be a faint pepper heat on the tongue . slightly sweet , but not a "" sweet "" beer . 4.5/5   overall : the balanced pepper kick be what make I really love Hunahpu 's , but even though it be largely miss here the apple brandy aging impart more than enough additional complexity and flavor to make up for it . I need to get some more .   recommendation : seek this beer out ; even those who be not good at handle spiciness ( I be look at you , Scott ) should be able to enjoy this one thoroughly .   pairing : fresh strawberry .   cost : $ 25 for a 32 oz ( counter - pressured ) growler .",0.4728662437434604

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"those of you that actually read past the fact sheet on my review know that I carry a strong inherent bias against pastry stout because I do n’t handle sweetness very well . some of you may have also notice that I do n’t seem as disenchant when it come to barrel - aged stout and barleywine , when they sometimes taste as sweet , if not sweet than other representation of pastry stout available on the market .   besides the actually unendurable level of sweetness that set light up my tas1r2 and tas1r3 with the force of hellfire , the thing that put I off most about pastry stout seem to be the drive force behind its popularity . I ’m not go to straight up say that I do n’t like pastry stout because of all the hype and attention they receive , because I myself be guilty of buy into beer and brand that receive hype and attention and actually enjoy they every once in a while , but it ’s probably because one of the thing I value most about beer be that it ’s proletariat and ubiquitous in nature ; if I like a beer , I want to be able to reach out into my fridge and grab another one , or run to the store and buy another without feel like I could have do well thing with my money — the reason why I value mouthfeel so much in a beer be because I personally believe that correlate most strongly into how repeatable a beer be no matter how flavorful or unique tasting a brew should be , I normally wo n’t want to try another unless there ’s some sense of balance or leveling factor that clear my palate for the next sip .   give my totally make - up standard and personal value state above , pastry stout could n’t stand any far from brew that I would normally be willing to pay an amount of money or stand in line for . I ’m pretty sure this comment will come back to bite I in the ass when I find myself stand in line for BA Double Stack next month , but I digress .   some ( actual ) preliminary thought about this beer . apparently german Chocolate Cake do n’t really come from Germany , and despite its name , its main highlight be whip cream and the coconut - pecan frosting that ’s use to fill the cake . on a more relevant note , this beer be well sum up by contrast it to the beloved Street Fighter zero character Hibiki Dan .   so for those of you that be n’t millennial or be live under a rock when Street Fighter , Dan ’s character be create as a parody of SNK ’s King of Fighters franchise character Ryo and Robert , who very suspiciously resemble Street Fighter ’s two most recognizable character , Ryu and Ken . outside of have twist mannerism and catchphrases suspiciously resemble the two SNK character that be rip off capcom character that he be rip off , Dan be kind of memorable for be all show and no power whatsoever ; his super / ex combo finish , Shinkū Gadōken , for example , look awfully similar to ryū ’ Shinkū Hadōken while do 1/40th of the damage it do — many - a - time have I sit in front of the tv screen , think "" oh shit I ’m fuck "" when I see the screen suddenly turn red , orange , and yellow while CPU Dan catch I off guard with my HP at 30 % , only to realize my character be still alive after be hit by ostentatious super combo .   labor metaphor aside , baigcc be similar to Dan ’s super finish in that it pack all the flavor it purport to deliver in one ginormous , sugar - spice - and - everything - nice upside your head , but then present a rapidly dry finish , which make you feel stupid for cringe and brace for impact — it ’ hard to explain in close detail , but it ’s like the opposite of get a penicillin shot at the doctor ’s , where you do n’t feel the needle go in , but it feel like somebody inject the meaty part of your butt cheek with peanut butter for the rest of the day . ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ a vacuum wave motion fist of toasted coconut , wild sugar cane , rum cake , baker ’s chocolate , intense caramelize sugar hit you square in the noggin , follow by a frost - like sweetness . there ’s a slight hint of hazelnut that follow the gargantuan sweet super attack before all the flavor just simply drop off the side of the earth . save for some residual flavor of hazelnut and powdered sugar , your pixelated character brush off the blow as if nothing happen and get up ready to fight again — the fight against the glass be one of attrition after that initial "" surprise "" ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ ⠀ the mouthfeel be initially thick and sticky like raw cake batter , but it morph into a more tolerable moist - ish soft texture with subsequent sip . the only way carbonation could make any impact on this beer be if it be effervescent to the level of a brut champagne ; the intense brick wall of mouthfeel counteract against any fleeting semblance of carbon dioxide on the tongue .",0.41079191812887456

Duck Duck Gooze,"when I take my first and only trip to great American Beer Fest in 2017 , I do n't know a lot about the lose Abbey - I 'd hear a few thing about Veritas , and I 'd try a select few of their beer . I be a fan , but I do n't pursue their beer to the degree that I do now . I know that Duck Duck Gooze be on the top 250 on Beer Advocate - but I never expect that I 'd be able to try it .   well now . I recently make a Facebook friend who use to live in San Diego but now live and brew in northern Minnesota . happy coincidence ! he happen to love sour , just like I do ... he help I out with a bottle of Duck Duck Gooze ( among other thing ) in our very first trade . I be thrilled , and still be - the beer be fantastic !   it be interesting to I how DDG differ from belgian gueuze though - the characteristic funk seem to be entirely absent , and the nose do n't pop to quite the same degree . it smell very nice , but it be a different sort of aroma - and taste . there be a bit of cheese to the taste , and a very light , clean , crisp sort of sour and tart character . again , the belgian funk be miss . perhaps this have be lose with time , but it surprise I as old belgian lambic still seem to retain that funk . there be also a marked lack of suspension - there be no noteworthy presence of fruit , yeast , or foreign matter of any kind . I do n't mind that ! I know some really enjoy that in belgian lambic , but it be a happy absence as far as I be concerned .   I 'd have to say that DDG characterize all of the thing that I love about gueuze , while it also happen to have bypass the aspect that I be not such a big fan of . it be a terrific beer , and really demonstrate why Lost Abbey be such a hyped and tout brewery . I think that I will always try far hard to pick up bottle of Russian River sour , because they be just a lot more accesible - but I will never pass on the chance to try another bottle of Lost Abbey . their sour , wild , and lambic be tremendous , and DDG be one of their good .",0.5659164584181103

I could see the acidity get overwhelming . its like too much of a good thing , a third of a bottle be exactly perfect . probably the good expression of apricot I have see in a beer , and the white wine note from the wood and the yeast be a great compliment to the fruit . easily the good of the beer I have have from these guy , and probably the new benchmark in the style . unlike the west ashley , this be entirely worth all of the high praise it get ! a memorable experience .",0.4815434123430769

Fuzzy,"review # 500 : Side Project - Fuzzy   batch 4 ( 2020 ) 375ml - pour into a tulip at 42 ° F .   pour a moderately foggy sunglow orange , not dissimilar to the peach on the label . a thin , coarse , break off - white head almost form , before quickly fall , leave only a razor - thin collar , and constant stream of effervescence . 4.25   Nose : signature Side Project pale base , with evident crackery grain , a touch of malt , and some dusty silo . the peach be restrain - apparent , but not loud , lend a very organic white peach aroma , much like nectarine . the acidity translate as fresh lemon juice , and just a splash of apple cider vinegar - tame , and bright . there be a ton of wet white oak - woody and musty , play with some funky wet hay , raw honey , stone cellar , dusty attic , leather , parchment , honeysuckle , lilac , dry leave , and peach blossom . not aggressive funky or tart .   palate : fuzzy greet the palate with a quick flash of tartness - lactic and acetic in nature , lend some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar . the peach , once more , be very natural and ripe , but not jammy . these be fruity , bright white peach , with most of their fructose ferment out . huge stone fruit note of peach , nectarine , apricot , and a big plum presence . remarkably floral , with honeysuckle , lilac , gardenia , and even a hint of honeydew melon . as the acidity curve , oak begin to show , along with a hint of sweet grain , which add nice balance . some farmhouse note of hay , wet wet , stone , and earth emerge , provide that true wild touch , with the brett add a nice dusty , sweaty , overripe element . it finish remarkably clean , with a general stone fruit presence behind a fade acidity , some subtle grain , and dry wet white oak , with nothing really linger .   Mouthfeel / body : it be incredible how Side Project can produce these 8 % ABV wild ale with such clean , crisp , snappy fluidity . Fuzzy be light - bodied , with no real malt weight , and quite dry , with no significant residual sugar . perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne , but with a similar feel - airy , clean , bright , and snappy . acidity be tart - sour , even , but definitely shy of puckering . the finish have some nice dry tannic oak . ultra - clean .   overall : Fuzzy be a bottle with a lofty reputation . long consider one of the fine fruit wild ale . that be a tall order . be it the great wild ale I 've ever have ? I would n't say so . be it the great peach sour I 've ever have ? most likely . what it most certainly be , be the definition of Side Project . yes , it be one of the more sour offering , use their high acid blonde base , but it be n't overbearing , and it be one of the more subtle offering - beautifully showcase the delicate nuance and balance that they be so great at . the tartness , the minerality , the organic nature of the fruit , the oak , the gentle funk , all meticulously blended . it really be a world - class wild ale , and one everyone should try at some point .",0.3962029078465308

Zombie Dust,"Howdy everybody ! good to be back ! man oh man I have n't do an actual review in a century . hell I 've barely do more than the occasional review over the past few year . do n't blame I ! blame the fact craft be die where I be at .   Saw this post by a local liquor store and knew I have to have the legend I remember hear so much about over the year . here we go !   look - Yellowish orange with a finger of white head . fairly hazy though twinge of clarity . low lace upon a finished glass .   Smell - Floral and seem to be load to the brim with Mosaic I remember so fondly before the juice bomb phase of beer decide to rear its head .   taste - Straight floral with some grapefruit goodness .   feel - right here be where I feel this beer really shine through . this be probably the smooth pale / ipa I have ever have in my near decade of drink the craft , go down silky smooth . almost like water but the body be n't watery . do that make sense ? probably not but you get it ... maybe . no I be serious . I 've almost finish the glass and do n't even notice . low bitterness even if it sit . seriously . how do FFF manage to achieve this smoothness ? it do n't even seem real .   overall - while I do not feel the flavor live up to the legendary status , this be ABSOLUTELY the smooth pale / ipa you be ever go to find anywhere . this will impress new craft drinker and the seasoned veteran all the same . $ 13.99 in my opinion be a bit stiff for a sixer , but if you want something flavorful that you can throw back in a pinch without any of the cloy sweetness and or bitterness that some of these brew can eventually take on , this be your guy .",0.6123724356957945

Zombie Dust,"this be one of those "" must try , "" beer to my knowledge , so I figure its worth reviewing .   look : pretty standard , but certainly hazy than I be expect . good lace though .   Smell : this be where it start to lose I a little . now it smell fine and all , but for a Pale Ale , it be simply way too hoppy . I almost think I have get the style wrong when I smell it .   taste : again , this be not a Pale Ale . it be clearly an IPA with the level of hop go on here . there be almost no focus on bring the malt up front , which be really what distinguish the two style for I . pa can be hoppy , even very hoppy , but they need to also give attention to the forward malt flavor . this beer only have a semblance of that . I guess it be more present than a typical IPA , but hardly so , and I would bet any beer drinker would label it an IPA if you give it to they blind . the taste be n't even bad , but to be honest it be a pretty standard fruity west coast style . nothing special either ; hop be n't particularly unique or interesting . as it start to warm a bit the malt come in , but right out of the can it be almost completely absent .   feel : I find it have a bit more success here . it be n't quite as heavy as a typical IPA , likely thank to the slightly low ABV . on the other hand , it be still far too heavy for a PA .   overall : I like this beer . however , it simply do n't work as a Pale Ale for I . there be plenty of hoppy PA 's I 've had that find that still manage to keep the malt characteristic of a PA ; this be not one of they . again , it be too heavy as well . either this beer should be label an IPA , or bring down to something like 5.5 % and give more malt focus . I do n't know why some brewery have these baffle mislabele beer sometimes , it put a huge stain on what would otherwise be a fine beer . the fact that this have the # 1 spot for Pale Ales show how biased some of the reviewer on this site be towards ipa . it feel like it have that spot because it be an IPA compete with Pale Ales , almost like an 8th grader compete in the little league .   regardless , even if this * be * just call an IPA , I still do n't think it would be the 40th good beer in the world which be what this site seem to contend . not sure where the obsession with this beer come from , maybe it be something before my time . also , a 6 pack of this be like 14 buck when there be plenty of $ 11 six pack I 'd say be way well .",0.8630637040042062

I see hue of cedar and magenta in the light . the head be thin and puffy white with an effervescent quality lead to thin and persistent droopy lace on the glass . it have a slight haziness , likely due to all the zombie that they grind up and put into this world - class brew ( lol ) .

I get strong note of tropical pith and skin such as overripe papaya skin , apricot , pineapple , and mango rind . I also get white pepper , green tea leave , grapefruit , crack rye , tobacco and pine .   taste - one of the most pleasant thing about this beer be its clean flavor . there be no sticky , cloying , or syrupy malty flavor and/or texture . it be rich in tropical fruit , pine , citrus , and bread malt . the citrus , pine , and mild sweetness from the toasty , bready malt hit first and then a piney hop resin take over in the most wonderful manner . the slight bitterness linger , and the effervescent pop mingle with it tickle your tongue .

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2018 vintage   750ml bottle - pour into a balloon stem at 50 ° F . huge thank to donniet79 for this longtime want !   pour an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorb every photon of light , with the single darkest head on a beer that I 've ever see , form - like a grade school volcano , it foam up - fine and sudsy , with the colour of light coffee bean , and then recede to a huge , persistent coarse bubbly collar that last forever . 4.75   Nose : incredibly rich . almost like a concentrate . deep , bold roasted malt with a particularly russian - style accord lend bitter baker 's chocolate , cacao , peruvian coffee , black treacle , toffee , caramel , marzipan , and vanilla . a slight , dense fruity thread lend a deep raisiny PX sherry note , with a hint of fig , blueberry , and dry cherry . I be fail to pick up any chilie or cinnamon , but there be a unique warm spice element , lend a hint of earthiness . not very mexican , but it smell delicious . 4.25   palate : the legendary Hunahpu greet the palate with an expertly dial - in balance between malt sweetness and roast . immediately , it let you know that it be not try to be a mexican wedding cake - this be a russian imperial stout , with a bold , heavy roast , deep , dark , bitter complexion , and lean drier on the sweetness scale . roasty be the main theme here . bitter cocoa , char malt , burn sugar , and burn vanilla lead the way , with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness . the pepper be there if you really squint , but rather than lend a chili heat , it be more of an earthy , dry spice . spice as in spice , not heat . I be not pick up on cinnamon , perhaps due to its age , but there be definitely some type of spice character that be lend an earthy aromatic quality . it grow dry , nudge out any sweetness , and the char malt take hold , up the dry , bitter factor . the faint little glow of pepper warmth emerge , and the stout conclude with deep , bitter roast , cacao , and an almost tannic bite to it , which linger , resurface with an espresso- like aftertaste . 4.0   Mouthfeel / body : despite its foreboding motor oil appearance , Hunahpu be quite drinkable . a bold , rich , heavy brew , but he be quite fluid , with a medium - full body , and very minimal viscosity . there be some fine , subtle fizzy effervescence , but it be relegate to the background , and only just contribute enough . the chilie warm only the gum , and it conclude with a dry , tannic roasty squeeze . 4.25   overall : this be a tricky one for I . I know this be revere as a legend , and be once highly seek - after , and perhaps the age do n't treat this one the good , but I have a hard time fall in love with it . it be a bit roasty and bitter for my taste , and feel it trend more in the classic russian style than anything else . it be a great RIS , especially if you like they bitter and roasty , and the hint of pepper be a nice twist , but I keep , wish that it be just a touch sweet , less roasty , with more caramel / toffee / vanilla / malt , and less cacao / char / blacken bite . I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though . I just find the roast a bit overbearing .   3.75",0.535899094331296

Anabasis,"there be two thing that most craft beer nerd get wrong about Anabasis :   1 ) the pronunciation of its name 2 ) the perceive G.O.A.T status of this beer in the realm of barleywine   it take nearly four year to track down a pour of this legendary beer , but only a fraction of that time to realize that I -along with the majority of the craft beer world- have be deceive by the Hype - Lords of the American Midwest .   Anabasis be a largely one - note barleywine that deliver on mild licorice flavor with a prominent bourbon barrel character on the front of the palate and little else . it miss the mark on what a truly great barleywine should deliver in term of taste . there be no depth of flavor or complexity to this beer ( on the palate ) , fall far short of the flowery "" taste note "" description that C. King offer on the label of the bottle .   perhaps the save grace of this beer be that it be remarkably thick , relative to other barrel aged offering in this style . to this end , Anabasis resemble more of a stout than a barleywine , which sit well with the mouthfeel chaser of the hobby .   if you be a true fan of the barleywine style , Anabasis be sure to disappoint , give the incredible amount of hype surround the beer and the overall underwhelming flavor profile it present . if , however , your flavor preference lean more towards simple stout , this may be the beer for you ; the mouthfeel and barrel character that envelop the base beer be world class and worth visit if the cost of entry be low .   the letdown of this beer remind I of my first Hill Farmstead Ann experience . a combination of low bottle count , high trade value , exorbitant secondary value , and craft beer FOMO lead to an artificially inflated expectation of the beer , one which ultimately detract from the overall enjoyment of the drink in my glass .   there be many other barleywine that can be acquire and consume with far less effort than it take to land a bottle of Anabasis that likely will yield a more enjoyable tasting experience .

I like green , weedy element in these type of beer when there be fruit ( and other ) sweetness to balance thing out . but here the green end up be a touch abrasive because there be simply nothing else to pay attention to . to its credit , there be still a number of fruit component to the taste profile , with orange , pineapple , grape , peach , apricot , and mango be clear enough to pick out behind the greenery . but each be extremely under - ripe and sharp with ( again ) almost no sweetness to it . the big kick come from the strong grapefruit , which I like a lot because it naturally fit with the pithy , bitter , almost sting overall personality . and while there be plenty of modern hazie that have sharp green taste profile that burn and be extremely starchy and/or vegetal , this be completely different -- it be a kin to pure , squeeze , under - ripe grapefruit juice that be clean fruit and pith with no sweetness . credit to Tree House for the naturalness of the fruit flavor , but you be almost wait for some natural sweetness to appear and it simply never do . I be really fascinated by this beer , and I see why it be seek after and love . it be just not what I expect ( even with the name Green ) and be n't really what I look for in a NE IPA . just a touch of sweetness would take this beer to another level . as it be , I find it a little harsh , simply dominate by grassy greens and bitter grapefruit . but it be still interestingly complex , and certainly true to its name .   soft , silky , but a little prickly from both the moderate carbonation and green taste element . zero alcohol heat . incredible linger grapefruit pith . nice coating on the tooth and tongue without any aspect of stickiness or chewiness .",0.46902858368074685

I like the juicy beer to have a bitter foil to they , but I feel like this one go beyond the use of kryptonite . I also just have to wonder how much of the intend beer I be miss because I be not taste it at its fresh . up front , there be a lot of tropical juicy sweetness - note of orange juice , unripe pineapple , and papaya . the mid - palate of the beer be fine , but unremarkable and that be probably what I be miss most from the lack of freshness here . the finish be soft yet nicely pithy , green , and bitter to help balance out all the sweetness and juiciness , linger long , and also leave a remnant of salinity and juiciness on the palate that be quite pleasant . I feel like I experience two version of the same beer in this can : the first half that be mildly hazy , light in body , more balanced , and more enjoyable , and the second half that be super cloudy , more pillowy , bitter , chalky , and unbalanced .   feel : soft and pillowy . appropriately carbonate .   overall : my second Tree House beer .

"" 6.00 % ABV .   head : none really ... just a floater ring that be rather thin and weak , dissipate in under 10 second .   body : also a bit thin and weak , and certainly dull with a deplete and dareisay undercarbonated look .   I imagine I be go to enjoy this beer , but we be kid ourselves if this be a perfect 5 for appearance .   aroma : Oak , barrel - derive vanillin , white wine , still cidre , obvious lactic acid . the bacterial aromatic be much more subdued than I imagine they 'd be come in ... they register , but it be not teem with lactobacillus like so many american brew sour ale ( I be look at you , Cascade Brewing ) . do n't seem as full of life and bacteria - ride as , say , Allagash 's coolship ale , but it be entice with promise of ample barrel character , microfloral intricacy , and diverse bacteria .   I do n't get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes find in well - mean sour ale and I find no sign of infection . some green apple , sure , suggest perhaps acetobacter . no vomit - redolent aromatic that would indicate butyric acid be present .   aromatic intensity be average for the style , maybe even a bit on the timid side . do n't scream acidity , but it do seem acidic judging by the aroma .   TASTE & TEXTURE : zap with mellow acidity and pucker yet mellow bacteria , hit on all front ( pediococcus , brettanomyce yeast , and lactobacillus . not a lactobomb , yield to the lactobacillus without let it dominate the beer 's flavour profile .   I ca n't shake the feeling this would be well fruit . some source of add sweetness would help counter its dry acidity ; this lack the tartness that often accompany sourness and I think it be bad for it .   Smooth , smacky , deliberately undercarbonated ( and to good effect , I might add , evoke a fine Brittany still cidre ) , a bit wet up front and a bit dry mid - body .   Oak and concomitant woodsy flavour tie the brew together without feel in - your - face , but I could do with more barrel flavour myself ... i'd guess this particular 2020 batch be age close to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claim range , and that much to its detriment . I do n't get barrel vanillin per se or rich toast oak , and the wine character be decidedly lack in term of depth of flavour . I mean there be faint white wine - perhaps mute Chardonnay or Riesling - but it be not as overt or nuanced as I 'd like .   Green apple / apple skin , orchard fruit , lime , rustic barnyard funkiness from well attentuate brettanomyce , scattering of microflora ( none of they as interesting as what one would find in a Senne valley sour ) , vinegar / acetic acid , grass , hay , maybe some faint clove / spice from aged hop .   I suppose the bacteria dominate . maltwise , I do n't get much beyond 2 - row and maybe a kiss of Cantillon - like cereal grain . far from a sweet ale , and I do think it 'd be well off fruit as note above .   overall : it be not a holy shit son of a bitch "" man , you 've get to try this ! "" sour ale , and it be not even Russian River 's good wine barrel aged sour ale ( I 'd tend to favour supplication in that respect ) , but as an american imitation of Cantillon 's spontaneously ferment sour ale , there be no doubt it be rather good , if not quite up there with the Allagash effort in the category . I do n't know that I 'd shell out for it again at this price , but I be glad to have get to try it . a long - time want and a damn solid ale , but I do n't know that it beat the pant off your typical belgian gueuze - many of which be easy to find than this and even as import cost the same if not a biteen less .   I be an unabashed Russian River fanboy , but while it be certainly rather good , the creme da la creme this be not , and how anyone can give this an honest to God perfect 100 rating give its obvious appearance issue ( and what I imagine be to many troublesome undercarbonation ) be beyond I .   b / good",0.6587366195483093

Nose : definitely that Bell 's barrel - aged aroma here . much like BA Expo , which make up half of this , there be a big , dense fudgy aroma , with plenty of dark cocoa - like roast , caramel , and marzipan , with secondary note of american tobacco , vanilla , leather , and bourbon barrel . there be some sign of age here - mildly fade aroma , as well as some unique note - musty , a whisper of umami , with a hint of fresh spearmint , and a metallic penny note as well , the latter of which be slightly detracting , but only slightly .   palate : Black Note greet the palate malt - first , with a moderate sweetness . dark chocolate , caramel , vanilla , toffee , roasted malt , and a surprising fruitiness . big plummy dark fruit note - mainly prune , plum , dry cherry , and bourbon - y apple lend a bright fruity pop , with a touch of acidity . this dark fruit element cut through much of the malty sweetness , create a shortcut for the roastiness to come in . dark malt , barrel char , roast , and cacao nib begin to build a mild - moderate bitterness , and the bourbon character begin to bloom . at this point , it begin to dry out fast , roast take over the sweetness , and dark fruit fade , as the beer barrel towards a finish with nutty malt milk , hazelnut , cocoa powder , a bit of black roast , barrel char , and ultimately conclude with dry oak and a linger vanilla cream note .   body : I can not say whether or not this be the age , but this one be definitely thin . unlike BA Expo , or even Vanilla Black Note ( which be not a super thick stout ) , this one be definitely a little runny , lack any and all chew or viscosity . definitely some effervescence , and it be fairly full ( perhaps medium - full ) bodied , but it be very fluid and thin .   overall : with Barrel - Aged Expedition be a personal favourite of mine , I have high hope for this one .

I have read this in a couple other review so not sure if this be typical of all bt , or if it be more isolated to this batch . or maybe some more time in the bottle would have help ? either way , it be a bit of a disappointment , especially for a beer that I have wait so long to try and so eagerly anticipate .",0.5773502691896257

The Broken Truck,"for how hype up this particular one be , it be nowhere near my favorite beer from de garde so far , and frankly nowhere near the objective well , if that s not nitpick at this point ( all of they be so fantastic ) . I love the story of this , but from the bottle , it do nt blow I away to the extent that some of their other have , especially some of the fruit one . its really sour , more acidic than I remember most of they be , and that slow down drinkability a bit for sure , even with the amazing carbonation , soft round mouthfeel , and relative dryness to finish , its still just a slow sipper for I , which be probably how lambic should be anyway , but its sour enough to be harsh in the belly , and that s over the line for my preference . perhaps this be a product of it be in the bottle too long , be a lambic type I be in no rush to open it , but not all of these age favorably apparently . the yeast profile under the acid be fantastic , musty bretty and funky , with distinct juicy fruitiness to it , white wine , apricot , even ripe pear , its rustic and interesting , but with the acid its pretty aggressive . the oak be sturdy here too , grounding and dense all the way through which I really like , it seem sort of oddly hoppy , like they definitely do nt use hop age down to zero alpha acid , and if they do , there be some weird organic compound in the mix here somehow . its get like a fruity linger in the finish I do nt normally associate with the style . despite the develop brett and heavy wood , this do nt seem as mature to I as I would have expect for something model on gueuze with the different vintage in the blend , less of the iodine medicinal character than the old world one bring , and less of the hayloft agricultural harvest rustic character , this be almost too refined to fit that bill , not a criticism just a commentary . I think i d like it more if the sourness be less , and do nt get I wrong I still love it , but I would take a great many of their other beer before I take this one in a hypothetical draft of their good beer . always a treat to have their stuff though , and I can safely cross off this bucket list brew for now ...   edit : this be league well the second time around for I , less acidity , a lot more nuance to the wild yeast profile , and with a fresh hoppy character to it at the end , ton of white wine , elderflower , and even white peach , its goegeous , and be a standout from a heavy session of amazing beer . not sure why it do nt taste like this the first time around , but I hve a raise a few score to reflect how good it be this time . huge thank to my buddy for share his bottle !",0.8486684247915056

Abricot Du Fermier,"this be really good , no doubt about it , but not as good as they say it be I do nt reckon , and once again a side project beer do nt quite live up to its hype . their culture have trend super sour lately , and this be another expression of that , just really acidic beer , complex still , still lot of nuance , bretty funk and oak and all , but its the bacterial intensity that take over this one and make it a hard large bottle to drink , even split a couple of way . I really like to let these type of beer warm up a little bit , but not here , its good when its cold , with temperature come acidic intensity that s hard on the tooth and belly . I like all the apricot of course , about as natural as it get , super ripe and even soft and fuzzy like the real fruit , very forward and incredibly natural and delicious , the authenticity be through the roof . I kind of want to taste more of the wine in the barrel profile , which be tannic and heavily oaky , but not as red wine forward as I might have think for cabernet . all the wood be nice , subtle vanilla and even white tea somehow , killer with the apricot , peach juice note , even green apple and white grape wrap up in here , lot go on , but instead of mellow into a slow tart bretty funkiness like I wish it do , the sourness crank and disrupt the delicate beauty , it finish harsh and big . I mean , in all respect this be great beer , but it just do nt stand with the good wild beer in the world to my palate , maybe those who prefer a more assertive acidity will disagree , but I think its a little too much , unflattering to the fruit , and at $ 45 a bottle it just do nt do it for I ...",0.40201512610368484

The Peach,"one of the beer I have be after for a long time have finally become a reality , definitely one I have be keen on , so cool to have beery friend out there ! this be unique in that its not just a peach wild ale , but one age in cognac barrel , really complex and good . its get a high shine and a pale color , bright but less than fully clear through most of the bottle , some little bubble come up , but somewhat unremarkable visually . it smell a bit more sour than a lot of the de garde beer have be in my experience so far , really piquant , slight vinegar character , white wine acidity , clean though , less funky , and I get the cognac immediately , some sweetness and some alcohol warmth to it , with the very natural peach its almost a baked dessert complexion , light vanilla and graham and even tobacco to it , nice complexity but very sour it seem . the peach be crazy juicy and real and ripe , very authentic here , and I know it would be base on the other fruit beer I ve have in the past from these guy , man I wish I have a reliable supply of their stuff ! the flavor here be excellent , again more sour than expect , but its a clean and lightly citrusy sourness , it seem build to balance the sweetness of the peach and even highlight its essence , the peach be bold from beginning to end here . the wood be strong , but the beer itself be quite light , minimal on the grain side , the peach really lead the way . the cognac though be an amazing tough , and I m not sure this would be anywhere near as exciting without it , despite the obvious quality . its nutty and deep than the oak alone , a golden raisin hint maybe , a sweet alcoholic layer , even cigar or something in the mix , just crazy , its amazing with the peach . I get a little less of the de garde funk that I like so much , more generic acidity , so I would enjoy more funkiness , but I ca nt complain . this be awesome overall , different awesome than expect , but great and really distinct with this combination of fruit and barrel . I hate to admit I have a little sinus thing go on and may have not experience this in its full glory as a result , ca nt control those thing and certainly be nt go to pass on it , so I will look forward to hopefully have this again . I love this brewery , its always a joy to drink their beer . this appear worthy of its hype !",0.7145267827077941

I pour the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass . the pour create a creamy and foamy dark brown two - finger head with excellent retention . the color chart around SRM 26 , dark brown like use motor oil without the highlight .   Coffee be strong and present with the initial nosing . dark roasted malt , toffee , molasse , a hint of smoke , a touch of char , and tobacco . the smell be dominate by the fragrant coffee aroma .   one of the strong coffee - flavor beer next to Oliphant Brewing Coffee Ale . the molasse , caramel , and toffee temper out the bitterness . this create velvety coffee flavor . the dark roasted malt give some char , bready , and earthiness to the beer . I detect   the mouthfeel be creamy , chewy , and bold .   the body be heavy , have low carbonation , and have a robust finish .   the coffee flavor in the beer be rich and flavorful . one of the good coffee beer I have consume in a long time . a must - try for any coffee stout lover .",0.6166698388447786

Double Shot,"huge thank to Alan for this one , and plenty of other long time want . this be one of those beer you just have to try at least once , so here I go !   Pint can - date 01/14/20 - pour into a tumbler at 50 ° F .   pour a gleam jet black - no head , until a two finger coffee bean - colour head race up , before race right back down to a still top , look like tar in the glass . like nothing I 've ever see . I 'll give a 5 to that .   Nose : black coffee . some roasty nuance , such as a hint of caramel , brown sugar , vanilla , and even a hint of dark fruit and red wine , but this be essentially sweet coffee .   palate : much like the nose , this be an absolute coffee bomb . it open up quite sweet , with lot of cocoa from the roast , which lend its own coffee character as well . moderate roast , accentuate by the coffee , but the hearty sweetness win over . secondary note of vanilla , caramel , brown sugar , molasse , and unfortunately , lactose . I know there be something unpleasant about this - there be clearly lactose in it . the lactose lend this quick spike of this almost aspartame / artificial sweetener flavour just before the finish , where it also extinguish any sort of roast that may have be . luckily , there be enough coffee for the more roasty note of the bean to come through in the finish , which help to dry it out .   Mouthfeel / body : the beer be full - bodied , and have a slick , oily feel to it . in addition to the naturally full body , the lactose definitely add , some viscosity here , as do the sheer level of sweetness . major stickiness be leave cling to the lip with this one . effervescence be actually quite adequate - low , but very fine and fizzy .   overall : all the component of a great coffee stout be here . the bean themself be clearly primo quality , with zero green pepper or stale note , the base stout be well - craft , but - it be too sweet , and there be just too much lactose . in fact , if there be n't any lactose , I think it could pull off the sweetness just fine , but with both element in place , it do become a bit cloying . I do not think the lactose benefit this beer in any way whatsoever . you can easily get that chewy feel without milk sugar , and it end up taste more natural . it be still good , it be still drinkable , but I 'd either like to see this tame by a bourbon barrel , or just lose the lactose all together .",0.16979054399120358

Roasted Malt somehow emerge through all of these flavor and enhance this beer , as it give it depth without make it feel dry or typecast in the process ...   amazingly , the booze in this be present enough to be feel but understate enough to let the other flavor take hold , from the get - go on out . a tiny presence of plum and dark fruit take hold before I finish this off as the acidity from that and the blood orange presence be enough to elevate this from the chocolate - coffee - vanilla threshold that hold so many beer of this type back . like their more famous IPA 's , this be a beer from Tree House that be worth seek out or trade for - ca n't recommend anything in this series highly enough !",0.3202563076101743

CCK be one of those beer that be n't even on my want list as I be pretty sure I would never ever get a chance to taste , but thank to the endless generosity of futur123 I be actually about to taste it ! thank man , I really owe you for this one .   appearance : the cork pop out with an almighty bang and for a moment I think I would get away without a gush , but as soon as I take my eye off the bottle pink foam start to rise slowly out of the neck . thankfully I have glass ready and manage to catch it all . the beer settle a clouded red - orange ( almost peachy ) with just a tinge of pink and be top by a large pink tint head . the head retention be reasonable , but sadly it do n't leave anything in the way of lacing .   Smell : wow , there be a ton of cherry in the initial nose and far sweet than I have expect - its almost jammy . a few more sniff reveal a fantastic acidity ( a touch of vinegar ) as well as a spicy almost cinnamon bark character . as the beer warm the nose open up with a little oak and some funk ( old hay , wet wood , mold and the faint hint of vomit ) become apparent .   taste : as the nose suggest there be a ton of sweet cherry upfront , but it be balance by a nice tartness and a fantastic acidity . note include : sweet jammy cherry , some tart cherry skin , a touch of vinegar , a little oak , lightly spicy , undergrowth , old hay and a touch of leather . the finish be quite dry .   Mouthfeel : initially there be a high level of rather expansive carbonation , but thankfully it settle down pretty quickly to reveal fine bubble that complement the acidity perfectly and lead to a fantastically spritzy finish . the body be medium and offer the faint stickiness from the fruit .   overall : cable Car Kriek be a fantastic cherry sour and quite a lot well than the regular Cable car . that say , I would be really piss off if I have pay $ 750 or what ever ridiculous price this be be sell for these day .",0.5261522196019803
Cable Car Kriek,"review a bottle of the test batch for Cable Car Kriek from the lost Abbey out of San Marcos , California . major thank to Paul and Jonathan for share this rare treat with I !   score : 100   the only thing I know about the bottle date of this beer be that it predate the 2011 release of Cable Car Kriek . my buddy get a Cable car Kriek label sticker , which he put on the otherwise unmarked bottle . serve in a Cantillon stem balloon glass and enjoy on 11/16/13 . review be from iPhone note .   appearance : pour a finger - plus of white frothy head . Color be a murky red - orange color with a bit of yellow - orange fade towards the edge of the body when hold up to light . excellent lacing and retention . 5/5   Smell : Cherry , then dank cinnamon , funk , wood , dank spice , fig , raisin , wood and lemon . hint of tobacco and vanilla . lot of unexpected cinnamon present in the nose , which be ridiculously complex and perfectly balanced between all the element present . just enough funk be present to give it an add dimension of complexity without detract at all from the appeal of the other aromatic . 5/5   taste : tart cherry hit first , then cinnamon , spice , vanilla and wood . Musty funk on the midpalate , oddly reminisce of that Cantillon house character with a little bit of age . Vanilla and cherrywood finish , light lemon backbone . dark cherry note and a little bit of cocoa - like flavor come through too as the beer warm up . the cherry flavor persist throughout , and linger nicely in the finish . I love how well the vanilla flavor play with sour character without be medicinal or come across as be out of place . all the flavor here be so perfectly integrate . there be so much go on , and it all work . the cinnamon character be a nice unique twist , though it be less prominent on the palate than it be in the nose . 5/5   Mouthfeel : medium bodied , spot on carbonation ( rare for a lost Abbey beer ) . great mix of sweet and sour , with a dry finish . 5/5   overall : one of the good beer I have ever have the pleasure to consume . it be complex , robust in flavor , tart , balanced and insanely drinkable . there be a reason this be one of the most seek after beer out there . I would not say it be worth the $ 600 - 800 it command on the secondary market , but I enjoy it more than M , which cost much more to acquire . my only quip here be that someone steal the bottle from Paul later in the evening . seek this one out with confidence .   cost : $ 50 for a 750 ml bottle ( good luck find it that for that price nowadays ) .",0.47336463120312877

I heavily prefer the "" batch 1 "" to the batch two for more reason than the difference in carbonation , it be a well beer . my score reflect the batch two though since if you be one of the few people cool enough to get a bottle of this for on site consumption at that prick bar in SF , this be the one you will get .",0.3651483716701107

Parabajava,"this review come with an asterisk , which be that I must have have a somewhat off experience with this one , in that there be no way the whole world love this so much and I find it unremarkable . I have want to try this for a long long time and be so stoke to finally get the chance , but I suspect a distributor or an account or even the brewery hold on to this keg for way too long , know they have something special here and want to save it for just the right moment . well , to I it taste like that moment have long pass by the time this one be flow , the coffee taste and smell stale , and it have seemingly break down some of the body that make this base beer so monumental . what I can appreciate be what its suppose to be , a rich espresso layer over one of the most flavorful and interesting stout to ever exist , an unnecessary but fancy layer , a little green peppery now , and a little acidic and thinning , but probably absurdly appeal in its prime . the alcohol be somehow really well hidden , maybe one benefit of its apparent age , ca nt believe its as strong as it be . some nice dark chocolate and char to this , still plenty of barrel on it too , faint vanilla and tobacco as well , lot happen but wonderful integration at the same time . I enjoy this still a lot , impossible not to , but in this instance certainly not one of the good beer in the world .

Barrel-Aged Sump Coffee Stout,"remember that Guitar Hero commercial from way back when with Heidi Klum wear nothing but a white button up shirt and sock , jam out like nobody be watch to Bob Seger 's "" Old Time Rock and Roll "" hold a Guitar Hero controller ?   well that be pretty much I after take one sip of BA Sump .   I do n't know if it be because I have n't have beer in a while , or because this particular drinking session happen after three - four week worth of very stressful life event , but for some reason I feel a sudden rush of incredible euphoria the exact moment the precious black liquid pass between my lip and my neurotransmitter start fire back signal try to decode the wonderment beckon my palatal and olfactory sense -- I guess this be why I be still obsess with a hobby that be detrimental to both my health and bank account ; which gift I with nothing but split headache and cottonmouth in the morning while steal my gain at the gym .   in all sincerity , ( regular ) sump be quite possibly the most coffee - forward beer I 've ever try . when I say that it be coffee - forward , I do n't mean the kind that your secretary serve you in a white styrofoam cup , lukewarm with creamer and two spoon of sugar . I mean the straight - up bold illustrious flavor that emanate out of fresh roasted bean that may or may not have be burn beyond the sixth layer of hell because you get your coffee at Starbucks . I 'd argue that the coffeeness in Sump 's coffee be more coffee than most coffee in a way a rose be a rose be a rose be not a rose , but I be probably get ahead of myself at this point so I 'll stop .   the aroma come out of the bottle be very much similar to its non - ba kin ; so much coffee that you do n't quite know whether you want to try and heat it up and drink it black , or put it in a cheap reusable plastic cup with ice , sugar , and saturate fat and serve it with a dollop of whip cream on top .   after some time and temperature , however , the command sweetness share its spot on the podium with a light hint of chocolate , and sweet cream clue you in that other element may be at play .   I have n't have a beer that be this straightforward since Weyerbacher 's Sunday Morning Stout . in fact , for those of you that have try Sunday Morning and be somewhat familiar with CrossFit : Sunday Morning be to Annie Þórisdóttir what BA Sump be to Katrin Davíðsdóttir . for those of you that do n't have a clue what that mean , they be both world class beer that I 'd drink again without bat an eye , but the latter edge out the former as a more robust all - round mesh of bourbon and coffee flavor .   in plain speak , I have yet to try a beer that come close to the perfect marriage of coffee and rye whiskey that I 've witness in BA Sump . neither flavor eclipse the other , while neither be express at less than 100 % of its expressable potential -- hell you might as well throw a scalding cup of coffee and a glass of whiskey in my face simultaneously and I 'd get all the same sensation , albeit without the masterful blending and delicious flavor .",0.4082482904638631

Bomb!,"* pour into a Teku glass from a 12 oz bottle *   the look of this beer be a very dark brown , reminiscent of cold brew coffee . this honestly do n't really have a head to it , so I ca n't really comment on the head , but there be a very thin dark drown lace around my glass .   the aroma be heavy on the ancho chilie , which be super pungent upfront . it be n't a one - note smell though , the ancho chilli serve as a backbone for an overall savory , slightly sweet , and unique aroma support by bitter coffee note and a slight caramel sweetness from the roasted malt . the aroma almost remind I a little of korean red pepper paste , but I can also see people think this also smell a bit like soy sauce .   the taste more or less follow the aroma . the taste of the ancho chilli with a mellow coffee backbone permeate throughout the entire stout from start to finish . although this beer primarily taste of ancho chilie , I be also really able to taste most of the different flavoring add to this beer . Upfront , you get the taste of ancho chilie with a mellow coffee herbalness / bitterness that be compliment with a caramel sweetness . the sweet taste of the caramel seemingly disappear towards the middle and end , which leave I with the roasty taste of coffee that be also pair with note of bitter dark chocolate and of course , ancho chilli .

Nose : the aroma be burst with ripe , succulent citrus aromas - orange juice , pomello , and grapefruit - along with a big bouquet of ripe tropical and stone fruit . lot of mango , some guava , pineapple , and a hint of papaya , with secondary note of kiwifruit , strawberry , blueberry , coconut , lychee , peach , nectarine , and a remarkably sweet , exotic fruity element that I simply can not place . the aroma be completely saturate , sweet , and fruity , and bear no earthy , musty , or funky component .   palate : the beer greet the palate with a forceful , sugary sweetness , which be to be expect from a dry - hop beer of this calibre . it be n't a starchy , malty sweetness , but rather a concentrated fructose sweetness , like ripe tropical fruit . speak of ripe tropical fruit , the flavour be burst with ripe mango , pineapple , papaya , and overripe peach , the latter be very indicative of the Galaxy hop that be cram into this . there be some bright , juicy , slightly acidic note of orange juice and grapefruit , which highly compliment the pineapple note , and also help to cut through some of the sweetness . much of this acidity be presumably hop burn , though it be restrain enough to be enjoyable , add a layer of complexity rather than be detrimental to the beer itself . there be just a touch of earthy dankness which be also to be expect from a bill contain any amount of Galaxy . I suspect the grist contain a measurable amount of oat , as the malt be clean , fairly neutral , and possess practically zero graininess . the finish be quite fruity and floral , before the sweetness gently subside , allow just a touch of resinous bitterness to peek through at the very end , before lift off , leave a clean , oaty dryness and a whisper of peach linger .

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"unbelievably huge thank to Anthony for this massive want of mine . very excited .   500ml bottle - b6 ( Feb. ' 19 ) pour into a fancy tulip at 48 ° F .   pour an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I be talk the Sorcerer 's Stone red . highly polished , highly reflective , mesmerise to stare at glow ruby gemstone red - clear , but not crystal . a finger of quick , loose , just - slightly - pink head build up , and then quickly reduce to a thin soapy collar . some slow effervescence can be see .   Nose : there be average cherry wild ale , and there be cherry wild ale that you can just tell be something incredible by the aroma . this be in the latter category . the amount of cherry on the nose be borderline unreal and saturated , while be entirely organic in nature . not only be this a cherry bomb aroma , but what be really impressive be how both the Montmorency and the Balaton cherry seem to translate . there be some intensely sweet , ripe , juicy Balaton character , lend an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note , burst with big , deep , dark cherry juice , while the Montmorency cherry lend that floral , fresh , tangy cherry note , with a touch of stem , pit , and even cherry blossom . there be also a healthy amount of oak , and , along with the cherry , seem to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note , with just a whisper of oaky vanillin . there be a suggestion of acidity , but it do n't singe the nose when inhale , and there be very little earthy or barnyard funk . just some wet oak , leather , old parchment , dusty attic , and a hint of brett . the cherry obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath . there be a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything , which be the icing on the cake .   palate : first thing , from the very first sip , it be n't brace sourness that hit , it be n't tannic oak , it be n't malt , it be sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh . the deep , bold Balaton sweetness greet the palate , give up its sweet juicy goodness , while never come across as artificial , cough syrupy , sticky , or overly sweet . this sweet cherry juice flavour unfurl to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath . the Montmorency be not quite as deep , bold , and saturate with juicy sweetness , but it provide a slightly less ripe , slightly fruity character , that bring japanese cherry blossom , a bit of plum , a hint of cherry potpourri , cinnamon / amburana wood spice , and a bright , natural , almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table . in addition to this subtle fruity tartness , the acidity lend a near - perfect degree of sour . it really be n't brace , puckering , or blind in any way . make no mistake , this be a sour ale , no question about it , but it be n't Midwest sour . there be some lemony lacto pucker , a bit less of some acetic pedio bite , and a bit more of some tart , funky , mineralic brett , lend not quite salinity , and definitely not sweat , but that classic restrained brett tang , along with some musty wet wood , a little hint of bandaid , and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note . the high degree of minerality pair with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really give this a little hint of a Kriek vibe . the tartness have a quick downward curve , allow some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish , pair with a hint of vanilla , a hint of baking spice , a hint of caramel , and a hint of brown sugar . the sourness take a far back seat , reveal some more dusty brett , and then finally , the ever - so - slightly sweet toasted grain base reveal itself , with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley , cereal grain , essence of cherry , and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish .   Mouthfeel / body : MvB be light , crisp , and snappy by nature , though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit close to medium - bodied territory . effervescence be surprisingly low . it be n't flat , but rather lazy and slow . one might expect this to be a super fizzy , champagne - like experience , but that be not the case , which also contribute to a slightly full feel . soft , round , and even quite juicy upfront , the ale be not scrub , and even feel somewhat smooth . the oak in the finish provide some tannicdrying as the sweetness fade , but the ale itself be n't tannic or ultra - dry .   overall : this be a really remarkable cherry wild ale , and an absolute triumph from Jester King . the perceivable difference between the Montmorency and Balaton cherry be a work of art , and the structure , balance , and progression of the ale be nothing short of impressive . the acidity be forward , but keep in check , the sweetness make a statement up front , and then take a support role , the oak and microflora influence walk a tightrope right down the middle of balanced , and the subtle malty , grainy base beneath it all be something that I always look for , but rarely get in highly acidic ale . this be just absolutely world class .",0.3620525686341854

I like this as much as I like either westly or fuzzy from side project in isolation , and think if they make more of it , it would have to be one of the most hype beer ever . its immediately in that range with stuff like fou foune , cascade , allagash , and the other great peach or apricot lambic out there . lot of wheaty body , even oaty , fluffy and expansive , inviting , micro bubble be very active in it too . I could nt imagine this improve in any way , its a truly beautiful beer . thank to claystation for share it with we , a real treat , and a new high water mark for casey , and that s really say something if you have be keep up with their release lately ...   edit : leave my original score in place , but we drink a batch 1 from age ago this weekend and it really have change . acidity ramp way up , peach fade way back , and just a totally different brew , still compelling and complex and delicious by any standard , but a far cry from what it be when it be new and the fruit character be so explosive in here and the funk be on par with the sour . maybe not mean for extended cellaring ...",0.47628967220784024

I go back and forth on the fruit stout , sometimes they get way too sweet and candy - like with the chocolate in the malt and the fruit sugar , but the raspberry be as tart as they be sweet in this , so while it have some residual sugar and raspberry jam quality , its also really natural tasting , clean , and fairly acidic from their tartness . its amazing how forward the fruit be in such a dense strong dark beer . sure there be still plenty of dark malt in here , its intensely roasty with a coffee quality to it , and there be some barrel char and earthy wet wood as well , but the summery brightness of the berry lighten it all up and really define this beer for I . rye be a smart choice for barrel too , its less sweet in this manifestation than bourbon would have be , and the dense slightly spicy rye character make the grain base seem particularly interesting to I . light vanilla too , but it be nt desserty so much . dark cocoa , a little bitterness , and whiskey , along with old school raspberry jam in the finish , its just delicious and about as well do as something like this could be . this remind I of an excellent raspberry stout I have from hardywood park a few year back but with the barrel , but other than that beer , quite original . worth the hype !",0.42107596053325946

I love honey . especially on hot biscuit where its cloy sweetness be the perfect foil to the starchy biscuit , especially with butter . with this beer , you get just the cloyingness , without really balance anything . the honey also add a definite silkiness to the mouth feel . some people no doubt really like this silkiness , but I 'd rather not have it .   I ca n't help think that the use of a different , more caramelized sweetener might have work considerably well in fuse together the IS and BA flavor to create something really special . something like maple syrup or brown sugar instead of honey .   on the plus side , they hold the honey back enough so that it be not a sweet beer ; it finish with a strong and excellent bitterness . it have a world class finish , but then I remember the cloy honey flavor and that the BA flavor do n't seem to add much , but just go along for the ride , and I realize there be room for improvement .

I get some wheat in the malt base , belgian pil , maybe some oat too , it have that fluffy texture to it . the oak be impressive here , maybe a slight suggestion of white wine , but here I get vanilla and sweetness from wet fresh oak , not a barrel of any kind . ton of must and musk and funk from the brett , an old school belgian type I would guess , remind I of some cool old world saison in that way . lemony as can be , but also pineapple , lime , and passion fruit come into the fold with the hop . what I want to savor and remember about this thing though be the yeast , I want it forever on my palate , I want to copy it in my homebrew , and I want every brewery who attempt to make beer in this style to try it , because this be what its suppose to taste like . unsure I ve have one I ve like this much . great carbonation , crackle dry , and with a very special mystique about it in general . I want to bathe in this stuff . my goodness .",0.6019292654288462

I 've now have Logsdon 's four most often rate ale . because of Logsdon 's extra effort and dedication , I can see why a segment of the craft market hold they in such high esteem . but Brett remain too much for my bud to like . and there also be the issue of premium price . so , it probably be time for I to focus elsewhere and , be a buddy - duddy , on the classic saison . try as I have , I guess I be still just a Euro Saison Head .",0.23570226039551587

Oak , a bit of vanilla . the whiskey start come out more as it warm , as well . Smoky , sweet , robust whiskey ; a nice complement , never quite emerge to the fore . overall , to sum up the full extent of the aroma in one sentence- tart cherry cover in dark chocolate with a bit of vanilla essence and oak ; mellow whiskey in the background . fair amount of acidity , but not particularly lactic .

Whiskey be there , underneath all of this . no heat , but a subtle char be noticeable towards the end . a very complex beer that seem to evolve with minute change in temperature , finally reach its peak at room temperature . even more cherry come out at the end . it be really a fascinating drinking experience .   the body be rich and substantial , which you 'd think would be strange for an awa , but it be substantial without be dry or creamy . smooth with good carbonation . different flavour follow each other in wave as they roll over your tongue , leave a pleasantly tart , oaky and mildly sticky aftertaste without any kind of heat .   overall , this be one of the more unique beer I 've have the pleasure of drink over the last 3 year . when I think about American Wild Ales and how they compare to their old world counterpart , I tend to find that most herald example of Wild Ales seem to be lack in complexity by be so boldly acidic .

Blanc De Blancs,"much thank to a good friend for share his bottle with I a few week ago . enjoy out of a green 375 mL bottle but I be not able to catch the bottle date ( if there be one ) . pour into a small belgian - style tulip glass .   Appearance ( 4.5 ) - pour a hazy golden color that remind I of the color of an egg yolk , but with more note of orange and amber go on than what you 'd expect . the head be about a finger at most and a fairly stark / snow white in color . it do n't last long before fade to a ringlet around the edge of the glass and just a faint swirl of foam across the surface of the liquid .   Smell ( 4.5 ) - there be a few key element present which all combine quite nicely . of course , there be a fantastic lactic acidity that make my tastebud pucker slightly in anticipation before ever take a sip . but alongside that , the vinous characteristic of white wine and oak , with even perhaps a hint of vanilla . and finally , there be a subtle hint of white grape tartness that be different in nature from the bacteria - base sourness that be clearly present . it add a depth to the sourness that might not be there without the fruit . I ca n't wait to dive into this and drink it .   Taste ( 4.75 ) - the flavor do not disappoint , with all of the element that present themselves in the aroma push through in equal part . Woody , musty oak and lactic sourness lead the way , induce a nice satisfying pucker and refreshing tartness . as with the smell , the inclusion of the wine grape give a bit of juicy sourness that balance nicely alongside some funky , yogurt - like characteristic . the finish be where the chardonnay come through , with crisp granny smith apple and white grape linger on the palate .   Mouthfeel ( 4.5 ) - medium - bodied and moderately carbonate , with a linger dry finish that entice the next sip .   Overall ( 4.5 ) , a fabulous beer , and my first in the Biere Brut style , although I ca n't imagine that this take could be consider typical . it be amazing to I just how sourness as a flavor profile can screw with one 's perception of ABV level in a beer . this one certainly do n't give away it be 10 % abv , and I 've have other sour beer that be burst with flavor but only have 3 - 4 % abv .
