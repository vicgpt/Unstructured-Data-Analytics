Paula trains for triathlons six times a week, and rather than locking herself in the gym, she explores and enjoys her city one run, cycle, and swim at a time, because Rio is made for sport. And so is Paula.

The triathlon gives Paula a chance to do a little bit of everything she likes. It also tests her will. She relies on mental toughness to get through training and has taught herself to not give in when she feels like giving up.

Why?

Because to get the most out of it, you have to put your most into it.

"“What motivates me is looking back and remembering everything me and my family overcame to get where we are. I gave it all since I was seven years of age.&quot; - @teeixeirale

Alexandre, a striker from Brasil, is now 17, and he’s more than 9,000km from the family that inspires him. The Niterói-Rio de Janeiro native is far from home and his comfort zone, pursuing the dream of a lifetime in England.

After winning the Nike Most Wanted trial in Rio, Alexandre battled 50 of the top undiscovered football players in the world at St. Georges Park and earned one of the eight spots in the Nike Academy.

For the next six months, he’ll train at the Nike Academy and compete against the best youth clubs in England, in hopes of earning a professional contract and going from unknown, to being known by one name.

"“It‘s very important for me to set a goal as clear as possible, who I want to become, what I want to achieve and more. Goals bring me in the right direction.” – @aaayu_03

2014 was Ayus best year yet. The break-dancer from Japan conquered new moves, saw new places and reached new heights.

She entered competitions regularly to find out what she was missing and used the competition to motivate her. But what motivates Ayu most are her goals.

She pictures what she wants, makes the time, takes things seriously and always stays positive.

So what’s she picturing for 2015?

International competitions and global success.

"“It’s not about waiting for 12/31 to make a resolution. Every day is a resolution.” – @fitsumnyc

Fitsums goal for 2014 was simple: Run better.

And he did.

10Ks, half marathons, the New York City Marathon – it was a year of miles, milestones and personal bests.

But it took a lot of work.

He joined the Iron Runners Crew and took advantage of Nike+ NYC. His crew pushed him and he pushed himself. He got faster with track workouts, he learned how to become a more technically sound runner and he used #NTC to strengthen his entire body and become a more complete athlete.

Now Fitsums approaching the 2015 starting line, looking forward to more marathons and more qualifying and more miles, because when happiness is running, that’s all you need.

Steve Prefontaine was a rebel with a cause: to never give anything less than his best, to never sacrifice the gift, to make you bleed if you were going to beat him. Win or lose, he wanted to paint something beautiful every time he ran. And he did. There was a formula to racing – conserve your energy, draft off the pack, then kick – but Pre never followed it. He didn’t fit the stereotype, but he ran so hard he became the prototype.

His style changed running. His soul shaped Nike.

"He didn’t like being called “Coach” because he was more than that. He was a Professor of Competitive Response. He was a self-taught shoe cobbler who turned an office underneath the west grandstands into an R&amp;D lab. He was obsessive, meticulous and curious. He was an innovator who would do anything to eliminate the unnecessary. If he could shave ounces off shoes, his runners could trim seconds off their times. He was the co-founder of Blue Ribbon Sports. He is the spirit of Nike.
