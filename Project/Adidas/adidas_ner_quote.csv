"“As a runner, you typically have a few pairs of shoes you’re rotating through. You may need a different shoe for long runs, another shoe for speed. We might run through a pair in a month and a half. So ideally, you’d have different types that meet different needs, but each pair would be recyclable. A shoe like this could mean that I’m not chucking 10 pairs of shoes in landfill every year.” ⁣

"“Just 5 to 10 years ago, if you owned more than 20 pairs of shoes you were whack. You had a problem. Then it was normal to own 20, then 50, then 100 plus. We have to change our thinking to the opposite. Let’s give back the shoes instead of keeping them in the closet. I think we’re still quite far off from that sort of thinking being widely accepted, but the shift will happen fast if the whole industry backs into it.” ⁣

"“When I first heard about [FUTURECRAFT.LOOP] I was skeptical. There’s a lot of greenwashing around, and I like to dig deeper. GEN 1 is 100% recyclable and although there’s no waste created, GEN 2 still means adding virgin plastic into the stream, which isn’t going to work in the long run. My question is - at what stage do we reach 1:1 recyclability? That being said, I do think it’s really important that big companies invest in this kind of innovation. This generation of the shoe might not offer the complete solution yet, but it could get us there. I have my fingers crossed for the future.” ⁣
